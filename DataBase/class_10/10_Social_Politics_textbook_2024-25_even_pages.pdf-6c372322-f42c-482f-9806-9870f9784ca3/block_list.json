We noted last year that in a democracy all power does not restwith any one organ of the government. An intelligent sharing of poweramong legislature, executive and judiciary is very important to the designof a democracy. In this and the next two chapters, we carry this idea ofpower-sharing forward. We start with two stories from Belgium and SriLanka. Both these stories are about how democracies handle demands forpower-sharing. The stories yield some general conclusions about the needfor power-sharing in democracy.

Politicalexpression of social differences is possible and sometimes quite desirablein a democratic system. In this chapter we apply these ideas to the practiceof democracy in India. We look at three kinds of social differences thatcan take the form of social divisions and inequalities. These are socialdifferences based on gender, religion and caste. In each case we look atthe nature of this division in India and how it gets expressed in politics.We also ask whether different expressions based on these differences arehealthy or otherwise in a democracy.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":32,"id":"178e6a2e-b985-440a-97d0-0bb368775afd","page_size":[636,826],"block_position":"32-5"},{"bbox":[466,388,506,555],"type":"title","angle":270,"index":6,"text":"# 3Chapter 3","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"level":1,"page_idx":32,"id":"588eca13-88cd-45ba-9ccc-efe5c78f7736","page_size":[636,826],"block_position":"32-6"},{"bbox":[28,769,41,780],"type":"page_number","angle":0,"index":1000006,"text":"58","color":{"line":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)","fill":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)"},"page_idx":32,"is_discarded":true,"id":"4ae55415-03c7-4a41-9ae2-7d416b4c2601","page_size":[636,826],"block_position":"32-7"},{"bbox":[29,812,82,821],"type":"footer","angle":0,"index":1000007,"text":"Chapter 3.indd 58hapter","color":{"line":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)","fill":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)"},"page_idx":32,"is_discarded":true,"id":"b560f946-3cb4-4be4-a85c-b853fc48370c","page_size":[636,826],"block_position":"32-8"},{"bbox":[547,812,612,820],"type":"footer","angle":0,"index":1000009,"text":"2/20/2024 4:04:34 PM/20/2024","color":{"line":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)","fill":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)"},"page_idx":32,"is_discarded":true,"id":"cf7839b4-ecd2-427f-bd5f-bf859d76c715","page_size":[636,826],"block_position":"32-9"}],[{"bbox":[35,545,50,756],"type":"aside_text","angle":270,"index":-999999,"text":"Gender, Religion and Caste","color":{"line":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)","fill":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)"},"page_idx":33,"is_discarded":true,"id":"0903b163-7851-451a-926f-35a4f64eaa2b","page_size":[636,826],"block_position":"33-0"},{"bbox":[189,88,350,109],"type":"title","angle":0,"index":1,"text":"# Gender and politics","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"level":1,"page_idx":33,"id":"4a3028dd-3fb9-479b-aea5-935f738a3bbf","page_size":[636,826],"block_position":"33-1"},{"bbox":[178,306,188,338],"type":"text","angle":270,"index":2,"text":"© Zuban \r\n","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":33,"id":"800dea56-084b-429d-9d06-cebd699428ad","page_size":[636,826],"block_position":"33-2"},{"bbox":[190,125,359,338],"index":3,"angle":0,"type":"image","img_path":"/ce0623fb925adac20d0171fc55fa703f5c174f2f1a34ccd9cb2bab603570e1c9.jpg","color":{"line":"rgba(89, 92, 220, 1)","fill":"rgba(89, 92, 220, 1)"},"img_ratio":0.26572327044025157,"page_idx":33,"id":"f1706dff-9751-4b7a-87e7-9405e4247813","page_size":[636,826],"block_position":"33-3"},{"bbox":[188,340,350,362],"index":4,"angle":0,"type":"image_caption","text":"A poster from Bengal affi rming women’sstrength.","id":"de277a4f-4942-4805-a3a8-74ee4abcbd0a","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":33,"page_size":[636,826],"block_position":"33-4"},{"bbox":[104,370,176,405],"type":"title","angle":0,"index":5,"text":"# GlO ssary","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"level":1,"page_idx":33,"id":"140f329d-b236-4710-8070-cb3960af2f25","page_size":[636,826],"block_position":"33-5"},{"bbox":[59,411,171,424],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":6,"text":"Sexual division of labour:","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":33,"id":"2cb40a8d-098c-483f-92be-920395fbce89","page_size":[636,826],"block_position":"33-6"},{"bbox":[59,424,153,509],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":7,"text":"A system in which allwork inside the homeis either done by thewomen of the family,or organised by themthrough the domestichelpers.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":33,"id":"62e7a835-d123-4b00-a284-c3ec4a8a13e6","page_size":[636,826],"block_position":"33-7"},{"bbox":[186,371,360,506],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":8,"text":"Let us begin with gender division.This is a form of hierarchical socialdivision seen everywhere, but israrely recognised in the study ofpolitics.
