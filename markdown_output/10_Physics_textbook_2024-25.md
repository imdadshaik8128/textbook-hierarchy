The National Curriculum Framework, (NCF), 2005, recommends that children’s life at
school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the
legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between
the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF
signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning
and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these
measures  will  take  us  significantly  further  in  the  direction  of  a  child-centred  system  of
education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).

The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will
take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities
and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate
new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the
prescribed  textbook  as  the  sole  basis  of  examination  is  one  of  the  key  reasons  why  other
resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we
perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of
knowledge.

These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning.
Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar
so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods
used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for
making  children’s  life  at  school  a  happy  experience,  rather  than  a  source  of  stress  or
boredom.  Syllabus  designers  have  tried  to  address  the  problem  of  curricular  burden  by
restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child
psychology  and  the  time  available  for  teaching.  The  textbook  attempts  to  enhance  this
endeavour  by  giving  higher  priority  and  space  to  opportunities  for  contemplation  and
wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.

The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the
hard work done by the textbook development team responsible for this book. We wish to thank
the Chairman of the advisory group in science and mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and
the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor Rupamanjari Ghosh, School of Physical Sciences,
Jawaharlal  Nehru  University,  New  Delhi,  for  guiding  the  work  of  this  committee.  Several
teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to them and their
principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which
have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. We are
especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the
Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development
under  the  Chairmanship  of  Professor  Mrinal  Miri  and  Professor  G.P.  Deshpande,  for  their
valuable  time  and  contribution.  As  an  organisation  committed  to  systemic  reform  and
continuous  improvement  in  the  quality  of  its  products,  NCERT  welcomes  comments  and
suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision and refinement.

This textbook of Science for Class X is a continuation of our attempt in the Class IX Science

textbook to comply with the guidelines of the National Curriculum Framework-2005. We had to

work within a limited time frame and also had our own constraints coming in the way of this

radical change. The revised and re-structured syllabus for Class X covers selected topics in the

broad themes of — Materials, The World of the Living, How Things Work, Natural Phenomena and

Natural Resources. We have interpreted the syllabus to present a coherent coverage of

scientific concepts related to our daily life on the select topics. It is an integrated approach to

science at this level, with no sharp divisions into disciplines such as Physics, Chemistry, Biology

and Environmental Science.

There has been a conscious attempt to address the relevant social concerns in this

science textbook wherever possible — the concerns for people with special needs, the issues

of gender discrimination, energy and environment have found their natural place in this book.

Students have been encouraged to get into the debates on some of the management

concerns (for sustainable development, for example) so that they can arrive at their own

decisions after a scientific analysis of all the facts.

This book has some features which are meant to enhance its effectiveness. The theme

of each chapter has been introduced with examples from daily life, and if possible, by a

relevant activity that the students have to perform. The entire approach of the book  is, in fact,

activity-based, i.e., the students are required to construct knowledge themselves from these

activities. The emphasis is not on definitions and technical terms, but on the concepts involved.

Special care has been taken so that the rigour of science is not lost while simplifying the

language. Difficult and challenging ideas, which are not to be covered at this stage, have

often been placed as extra material in the boxes in light orange. The excitement of doing

science comes from pursuing the unknown — the students would have the opportunity to think

and explore somewhat beyond the syllabus and may feel the urge to continue their scientific

expedition at higher levels. All such box items, including brief biography of scientists, are, of

course, non-evaluative.

Solved examples are provided, wherever felt necessary, to clarify a concept. The in-text

questions after a main section are for the students to check their understanding of the topic. At

the end of each chapter, there is a quick review of the important points covered in the chapter.

We have introduced some multiple choice questions in the exercises. There are problems of

different difficulty levels answers to the multiple-choice questions and numericals, and hints for

the difficult questions are included at the end of the book.

This book has been made possible because of the active participation of many

people. I wish to thank Professor Krishna Kumar, Director, NCERT, Prof. G. Ravindra, Joint

Director, NCERT, and Professor Hukum Singh, Head, Department of Education in Science and

Mathematics, NCERT, specially for their keen interest in the development of the book and for all

the administrative support. I wish to put on record my sincere appreciation for Dr Anjni Koul, the

member-coordinator  of  the  textbook  development  committee,  for  her  extraordinary

commitment  and  efficiency.  It  has  been  a  real  pleasure  working  with  my  textbook

development team and the review committee. The chosen editorial team worked extremely

hard, on tight deadlines, to bring the book close to the shape that we dreamt of. Fruitful

discussions with some members of the MHRD Monitoring Committee helped in providing the

final touches to the book. I do not have the words to acknowledge the professional and

personal inputs I received from some of my close friends during the preparation of this book. We

warmly welcome comments and suggestions for improvement from our readers.

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on students. The

National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content load and providing

opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has

undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes

already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this

exercise.

Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:

Ÿ

Ÿ

Ÿ

Ÿ

  Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same class

Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject

Difficulty level

Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions from

            teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning

Ÿ

Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes given above.

 onsider the following situations of daily

Clife and think what happens when -

• milk  is  left  at  room  temperature  during

•

summers.
an  iron  tawa/pan/nail  is  left  exposed  to
humid atmosphere.
 grapes get fermented.
food is cooked.
food gets digested in our body.

•
•
•
• we respire.
In all the above situations, the nature and the
identity of the initial substance have somewhat
changed. We have already learnt about physical
and chemical changes of matter in our previous
classes. Whenever a chemical change occurs,
we can say that a chemical reaction has taken
place.
        You may perhaps be wondering as to what
is actually meant by a chemical reaction. How
do we come to know that a chemical reaction
has taken place? Let us perform some activities
to ﬁnd the answer to these questions.

CAUTION:  This Activity  needs    the
teacher’s assistance. It would be better
if students wear suitable eyeglasses.
■ Clean a magnesium ribbon about 3-
4  cm  long  by  rubbing    it  with
sandpaper.

■ Hold it with a pair of tongs. Burn it
using  a  spirit  lamp  or  burner  and
collect  the  ash  so  formed  in  a
watch-glass  as  shown  in  Fig.  1.1.
Burn    the    magnesium  ribbon
keeping it away as far as possible
from your eyes.

You  must  have  observed  that  magnesium
ribbon burns with a dazzling white ﬂame and
changes  into  a  white  powder. This  powder  is
magnesium  oxide.  It  is  formed  due  to  the
reaction  between  magnesium  and  oxygen
present in the air.

■ Take lead nitrate solution in a test tube.

■ Add potassium iodide solution to this.

■ What do you observe?

■ Take a few zinc granules in a conical

ﬂask or a test tube.

■ Add  dilute  hydrochloric  acid  or

sulphuric acid to this (Fig. 1.2).

CAUTION: Handle the acid with care.

■ Do you observe anything happening

around the zinc granules?

■

Touch the conical ﬂask or test tube. Is
there any change in its temperature?

From the above three activities, we can say that
any of the following observations helps us to
determine  whether  a  chemical  reaction  has
taken place –

As we observe the changes around us, we can
see  that  there  is  a  large  variety  of  chemical
reactions taking place around us. We will study
about the various types of chemical reactions
and  their  symbolic  representation  in  this
Chapter.

1.1 CHEMICAL EQUATIONS
Activity  1.1  can  be  described  as  –  when  a
magnesium ribbon is burnt in oxygen, it gets
converted  to  magnes ium  oxide.  This
description of a chemical reaction in a sentence
form is quite long. It can be written in a shorter
form. The simplest way to do this is to write it in
the form of a word-equation.
The  word-equation  for  the  above  reaction
would be –

Magnesium + Oxygen®Magnesium oxide

(Reactants)

         (Product)         (1.1)

The substances that undergo chemical change
in the reaction (1.1), magnesium and oxygen,
are  the  reactants.  The  new  substance  is
magnesium oxide, formed during the reaction,
as a product. A word-equation shows change of
reactants to products through an arrow placed
between them. The reactants are written on the
left-hand  side  (LHS)  with  a  plus  sign  (+)
between them. Similarly, products are written
on the right-hand side (RHS) with a plus sign
(+)  between  them.  The  arrowhead  points
towards the products, and shows the direction
of the reaction.

1.1.1 Writing a Chemical Equation
Is there any other shorter way for representing
chemical  equations?  Chemical  equations  can
be  made  more  concise  and  useful  if  we  use
chemical  formulae  instead  of  words.  A
chemical  equation  represents  a  chemical
reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium,
oxygen and magnesium oxide, the above word-
equation can be written as –

2

(1.2)

Mg + O   ®  MgO
Count  and  compare  the  number  of  atoms  of
each element on the LHS and RHS of the arrow.
Is  the  number  of  atoms  of  each  element  the
same on both the sides? If yes, then the equation
is  balanced.  If  not,  then  the  equation  is
unbalanced because the mass is not the same on
both  sides  of  the  equation.  Such  a  chemical
equation is a skeletal chemical equation for a
reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical
equation for the burning of magnesium in air.
1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations
Recall the law of conservation of mass that you
studied in Class IX; mass can neither be created
nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is,
the  total  mass  of  the  elements  present  in  the
products of a chemical reaction has to be equal
to the total mass of the elements present in the
reactants.
In other words, the number of atoms of each
element remains the same, before and after a
chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a
skeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq.
(1.2) balanced? Let us learn about balancing a
chemical equation step by step.
The  word-equation  for  Activity  1.3  may  be
represented as –

The above word-equation may be represented
by the following chemical equation –

Zn + H SO  ® ZnSO  + H
2

2

4

4

(1.3)

Let  us  examine  the  number  of  atoms  of
different elements on both sides of the arrow.

Zn

H

S

O

1

2

1

4

        1

        2

        1

        4

As the number of atoms of each element is the
same on both sides of the arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a
balanced chemical equation.

Let  us  try  to  balance  the  following  chemical
equation –

Fe + H O ® Fe O  + H
2

4

3

1.1.1 Writing a Chemical Equation

The above word-equation may be represented

by the following chemical equation –

Zn + H SO  ® ZnSO  + H

2

4

4

2

(1.3)

Let  us  examine  the  number  of  atoms  of

different elements on both sides of the arrow.

Is there any other shorter way for representing

chemical  equations?  Chemical  equations  can

be  made  more  concise  and  useful  if  we  use

chemical  formulae  instead  of  words.  A

chemical  equation  represents  a  chemical

reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium,

oxygen and magnesium oxide, the above word-

equation can be written as –

Mg + O   ®  MgO

2

(1.2)

Count  and  compare  the  number  of  atoms  of

each element on the LHS and RHS of the arrow.

Is  the  number  of  atoms  of  each  element  the

same on both the sides? If yes, then the equation

is  balanced.  If  not,  then  the  equation  is

unbalanced because the mass is not the same on

both  sides  of  the  equation.  Such  a  chemical

equation is a skeletal chemical equation for a

reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical

equation for the burning of magnesium in air.

1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations

Recall the law of conservation of mass that you

studied in Class IX; mass can neither be created

nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is,

the  total  mass  of  the  elements  present  in  the

products of a chemical reaction has to be equal

to the total mass of the elements present in the

reactants.

chemical equation step by step.

The  word-equation  for  Activity  1.3  may  be

Zinc  +  Sulphuric  acid  ®  Zinc  sulphate  +

represented as –

        1

        2

As the number of atoms of each element is the

same on both sides of the arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a

In other words, the number of atoms of each

balanced chemical equation.

element remains the same, before and after a

chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a

skeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq.

equation becomes–

3

4

2

(1.5)

            (partly balanced equation)

Step IV: Fe and H atoms are still not balanced.
Pick any of these elements to proceed further.
Let  us  balance  hydrogen  atoms  in  the  partly
balanced equation.

To equalise the number of H atoms, make the
number of molecules of hydrogen as four on the
RHS.

(I)  Initial

8 (in 4H O)

2

          4 (in H )
2

(ii) To
     balance

      8

            2 × 4

The equation would be –

   Fe   + 4  H O   ®   Fe O    + 4  H

3

4

2

2

(1.5)

            (partly balanced equation)

Step  I:  To  balance  a  chemical  equation,  ﬁrst
draw  boxes  around  each  formula.  Do  not
change  anything  inside  the  boxes  while
balancing the equation.

  Fe   +   H O   ®   Fe O    +   H       (1.5)
3

4

2

2

Step II: List the number of atoms of different
elements  present  in  the  unbalanced  equation
(1.5).

Fe

H

O

1

2

1

       3

       2

       4

Step  III:  It  is  often  convenient  to  start
balancing with the compound that contains the
maximum  number  of  atoms.  It  may  be  a
reactant or a product. In that compound, select
the element which has the maximum number of
atoms. Using these criteria, we select Fe O and
the element oxygen in it. There are four oxygen
atoms on the RHS and only one on the LHS.

4

3

To balance the oxygen atoms –

(I)  Initial

1 (in H O)

2

     4 (in Fe O )
4

3

(ii) To
     balance

     1×4

  4

To  equalise  the  number  of  atoms,  it  must  be
remembered that we cannot alter the formulae
of the compounds or elements involved in the
reactions.  For  example,  to  balance  oxygen
atoms we can put coefficient ‘4’ as 4 H O and

Step IV: Fe and H atoms are still not balanced.

Pick any of these elements to proceed further.

Let  us  balance  hydrogen  atoms  in  the  partly

balanced equation.

To equalise the number of H atoms, make the

number of molecules of hydrogen as four on the

RHS.

Step  III:  It  is  often  convenient  to  start

balancing with the compound that contains the

maximum  number  of  atoms.  It  may  be  a

reactant or a product. In that compound, select

atoms. Using these criteria, we select Fe O and

the element oxygen in it. There are four oxygen

atoms on the RHS and only one on the LHS.

To balance the oxygen atoms –

To  equalise  the  number  of  atoms,  it  must  be

remembered that we cannot alter the formulae

of the compounds or elements involved in the

reactions.  For  example,  to  balance  oxygen

atoms we can put coefficient ‘4’ as 4 H O and

■ Take lead nitrate solution in a test tube.

■ Add potassium iodide solution to this.

■ What do you observe?

Step V: Examine the above equation and pick
up the third element which is not balanced. You
ﬁnd that only one element is left to be balanced,
that is, iron.

products are represented by the notations (g),
(l), (aq) and (s), respectively. The word aqueous
(aq)  is  written  if  the  reactant  or  product  is
present as a solution in water.

The balanced Eq. (1.9) becomes

     1 × 3

To equalise Fe, we take three atoms of Fe on the
LHS.

3   Fe   +   4   H O   ®   Fe O    +   4   H      (1.8)

3

4

2

2

Step VI: Finally, to check the correctness of the
balanced  equation,  we  count  atoms  of  each
element on both sides of the equation.

3   Fe   +   4   H O   ®   Fe O    +   4   H      (1.9)

       (balanced equation)

The  numbers  of  atoms  of  elements  on  both
sides  of  Eq.  (1.9)  are  equal. This  equation  is
now  balanced.  This  method  of  balancing
chemical  equations  is  called  hit-and-trial
method  as  we  make  trials  to  balance  the
equation by using the smallest whole number
coefficient.

Step VII: Writing Symbols of Physical States
Carefully  examine  the  above  balanced  Eq.
(1.9). Does this equation tell us anything about
the physical state of each reactant and product?
No information has been given in this equation
about their physical states.

To   m a k e   a   c h e m i c a l   e q u a t i o n   m o r e
informative, the physical states of the reactants
and  products  are  mentioned  along  with  their
chemical  formulae.  The  gaseous,  liquid,
aqueous and solid states of reactants and

4

Note  that  the  symbol  (g)  is  used  with
H O  to  indicate  that  in  this  reaction  water  is
used in the form of steam.

2

Usually physical states are not included
in a chemical equation unless it is necessary to
specify them.

Sometimes the reaction conditions, such
as temperature, pressure, catalyst, etc., for the
reaction are indicated above and/or below the
arrow in the equation. For example –

CO(g) + 2H (g)

sides  of  Eq.  (1.9)  are  equal. This  equation  is

now  balanced.  This  method  of  balancing

chemical  equations  is  called  hit-and-trial

method  as  we  make  trials  to  balance  the

equation by using the smallest whole number

coefficient.

1.2  TYPES OF CHEMICAL REACTIONS

We  have  learnt  in  Class  IX  that  during  a
chemical reaction atoms of one element do not
change into those of another element. Nor do
atoms  disappear  from  the  mixture  or  appear
from  elsewhere. Actually,  chemical  reactions
involve  the  breaking  and  making  of  bonds
between atoms to produce new substances. You
will  study  about  types  of  bonds  formed
between atoms in Chapters 3 and 4.

1.2.1 Combination Reaction

■ Take a small amount of calcium oxide or

quick lime in a beaker.

■ Slowly add water to this.

■ Touch the beaker as shown in Fig. 1.3.

■ Do you feel any change in  temperature?

(ii)  Sodium  hydroxide  solution  (in
water)  reacts  with  hydrochloric  acid
solution (in water) to produce sodium
chloride solution and water.

Calcium oxide reacts vigorously with water to produce slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) releasing a
large amount of heat.

A  solution  of  slaked  lime  produced  by  the  reaction  1.13  is  used  for  whitewashing  walls.
Calcium hydroxide reacts slowly with the carbon dioxide in air to form a thin layer of calcium
carbonate on the walls. Calcium carbonate is  formed after two to three days of whitewashing
and gives a shiny ﬁnish to the walls. It is interesting to note that the chemical formula for
marble is also CaCO .3

In simple language we can say that when two or
more  substances  (elements  or  compounds)
combine to form a single product, the reactions
are called combination reactions.

In Activity 1.4, we also observed that a large
amount  of  heat  is  evolved.  This  makes  the
reaction  mixture  warm.  Reactions  in  which
heat  is  released  along  with  the  formation  of
products  are  called  exothermic  chemical
reactions.

Other examples of exothermic reactions are –

(I)  Burning of natural gas

CH (g) + 2O  (g) ® CO  (g) + 2H O (g)

      In this reaction you can observe that a single
reactant breaks down to give simpler products.
This  is  a  decomposition  reaction.  Ferrous
sulphate  crystals  (FeSO ,  7H O)  lose  water
when  heated  and  the  colour  of  the  crystals
changes.  It  then  decomposes  to  ferric  oxide
(Fe O ),  sulphur  dioxide  (SO )  and  sulphur
trioxide (SO ). Ferric oxide is a solid, while SO
2
and SO  are gases.

      Decomposition  of  calcium  carbonate  to
calcium oxide and carbon dioxide on heating is
an  important  decomposition  reaction  used  in
various industries. Calcium oxide is called lime
or quick lime. It has many uses – one is in the
manufacture of cement. When a decomposition

Let  us  perform  some  more  decomposition
reactions as given in Activities 1.7 and 1.8.

■ n  Take a plastic mug. Drill two holes
at  its  base  and  ﬁt  rubber  stoppers  in
these holes. Insert carbon electrodes in
these rubber stoppers as shown in Fig.
1.6.

■ Connect  these  electrodes  to  a  6  volt

battery.

■ Fill  the  mug  with  water  such  that  the
electrodes  are  immersed.  Add  a  few
drops  of  dilute  sulphuric  acid  to  the
water.

■ Take two test tubes ﬁlled with water and
invert  them  over  the  two  carbon
electrodes.

■ Switch  on  the  current  and  leave  the
apparatus undisturbed for some time.
■ You  will  observe  the  formation  of
bubbles  at  both  the  electrodes.  These
bubbles displace water in the test tubes.
■ Is the volume of the gas collected the

same in both the test tubes?

■ Once the test tubes are ﬁlled with the
r e s p e c t i v e   g a s e s ,   r e m o v e   t h e m
carefully.

■ Test these gases one by one by bringing
a burning candle close to the mouth of
the test tubes.
 CAUTION:

This step must be

     performed carefully by the teacher.
■ What happens in each case?
■ Which gas is present in each test tube?

■ n  Take a plastic mug. Drill two holes

at  its  base  and  ﬁt  rubber  stoppers  in

these holes. Insert carbon electrodes in

these rubber stoppers as shown in Fig.

■ Connect  these  electrodes  to  a  6  volt

■ Fill  the  mug  with  water  such  that  the

electrodes  are  immersed.  Add  a  few

drops  of  dilute  sulphuric  acid  to  the

1.6.

battery.

water.

■ Take two test tubes ﬁlled with water and

invert  them  over  the  two  carbon

electrodes.

■ Switch  on  the  current  and  leave  the

apparatus undisturbed for some time.

■ You  will  observe  the  formation  of

bubbles  at  both  the  electrodes.  These

bubbles displace water in the test tubes.

■ Is the volume of the gas collected the

same in both the test tubes?

■ Once the test tubes are ﬁlled with the

r e s p e c t i v e   g a s e s ,   r e m o v e   t h e m

carefully.

■ Test these gases one by one by bringing

a burning candle close to the mouth of

the test tubes.

 CAUTION:

This step must be

     performed carefully by the teacher.

■ What happens in each case?

■ Which gas is present in each test tube?

The above reactions are used in black and white
photography. What form of energy is causing
these decomposition reactions?

      We  have  seen  that  the  decomposition
reactions require energy either in the form of
heat, light or electricity for breaking down the
reactants.  Reactions  in  which  energy  is
absorbed are known as endothermic reactions.

Take about 2 g barium hydroxide in a test
tube. Add  1  g  of  ammonium  chloride  and
mix with the help of a glass rod. Touch the
bottom of the test tube with your palm. What
do  you  feel?  Is  this  an  exothermic  or
endothermic reaction?

1. A solution of a substance ‘X’ is used for

whitewashing.

     (i)  Name the substance ‘X’ and write its

formula.

     (ii)  Write  the  reaction  of  the  substance

‘X’ named in (i) above with water.

2.  Why is the amount of gas collected in one
of the test tubes in Activity 1.7 double of
the amount collected in the other? Name
this gas.

■ Take three iron nails and clean them by

rubbing with sand paper.

■ Take two test tubes marked as (A) and
(B). In each test tube, take about 10 mL
copper sulphate solution.

■ Tie  two  iron  nails  with  a  thread  and
immerse  them  carefully  in  the  copper
sulphate solution in test tube B for about
20 minutes [Fig. 1.8 (a)]. Keep one iron
nail aside for comparison.

■ After 20 minutes, take out the iron nails

from the copper sulphate solution.

■ Compare  the  intensity  of  the  blue
colour of copper sulphate solutions in
test tubes (A) and (B) [Fig. 1.8 (b)].

Why  does  the  iron  nail  become  brownish  in
colour and the blue colour of copper sulphate
solution fades?

■ Take  about  3  mL  of  sodium  sulphate

solution in a test tube.

■ In another test tube, take about 3 mL of

barium chloride solution.

■ Mix the two solutions (Fig. 1.9).
■ What do you observe?

You will observe that a white substance, which
is insoluble in water, is formed. This insoluble
substance  formed  is  known  as  a  precipitate.
Any reaction that produces a precipitate can be
called a precipitation reaction.

    What causes this? The  white precipitate of
BaSO   is  formed  by  the  reaction  of  SO   and
2+Ba .  The  other  product  formed  is  sodium
chloride  which  remains  in  the  solution.  Such
reactions in which there is an exchange of ions
between  the  reactants  are  called  double
displacement reactions.

If  hydrogen  gas  is  passed  over  this  heated

surface  turns  brown  as  the  reverse  reaction
takes place and copper is obtained.

Recall Activity 1.2: where you have mixed the
solutions  of  lead(II)  nitrate  and  potassium
iodide.

(I)      What  was  the  colour  of  the  precipitate
formed?  Can  you  name  the  compound
precipitated?

(ii)   Write the balanced chemical equation for
this reaction.

(iii)    Is  this  also  a  double  displacement
reaction?

If a substance gains oxygen during a reaction, it
is  said  to  be  oxidised.  If  a  substance  loses
oxygen  during  a  reaction,  it  is  said  to  be
reduced.

During  this  reaction  (1.29),  the  copper(II)
oxide  is  losing  oxygen  and  is  being  reduced.
The hydrogen is gaining oxygen and is being
oxidised.  In  other  words,  one  reactant  gets
oxidised while the other gets reduced during a
reaction. Such reactions are called oxidation-
reduction reactions or redox reactions.

1.2.5 Oxidation and Reduction

                    (1.30)

■ Heat a china dish containing about 1 g

copper powder (Fig. 1.10).

■ What do you observe?

The surface of copper powder becomes coated
with black copper(II) oxide. Why has this black
substance formed?

This is because oxygen is added to copper and
copper oxide is formed.

This is because oxygen is added to copper and

copper oxide is formed.

1.2.5 Oxidation and Reduction

■ Heat a china dish containing about 1 g

copper powder (Fig. 1.10).

■ What do you observe?

From the above examples we can say that if a
substance  gains  oxygen  or  loses  hydrogen
during a reaction, it is oxidised. If a substance
loses  oxygen  or  gains  hydrogen  during  a
reaction, it is reduced.

Recall  Activity  1.1:  where  a  magnesium
ribbon  burns  with  a  dazzling  ﬂame  in  air
(oxygen) and changes into a white substance,
magnesium  oxide.  Is  magnesium  being
oxidised or reduced in this reaction?

1.3  HAVE YOU OBSERVED THE
 EFFECTS OF OXIDATION REACTIONS
 IN EVERYDAY LIFE?

1.3.1 Corrosion

You must have observed that iron articles are
shiny when new, but get coated with a reddish
brown powder when left for some time. This
process is commonly known as rusting of iron.
Some  other  metals  also  get  tarnished  in  this
manner.  Have  you  noticed  the  colour  of  the
coating formed on copper and silver? When a
metal is attacked by substances around it such
as moisture, acids, etc., it is said to corrode and
this  process  is  called  corrosion.  The  black
coating  on  silver  and  the  green  coating  on
copper are other examples of corrosion.

Corrosion  causes  damage  to  car  bodies,
bridges, iron railings, ships and to all objects
made  of  metals,  specially  those  of  iron.
Corrosion of iron is a serious problem. Every

28

year an enormous amount of money is spent to
replace  damaged  iron.  You  will  learn  more
about corrosion in Chapter 3.

1.3.2 Rancidity

Have  you  ever  tasted  or  smelt  the  fat/oil
containing food materials left for a long time?

When fats and oils are oxidised, they become
rancid and their smell and taste change. Usually
s u b s t a n c e s   w h i c h   p r e v e n t   o x i d a t i o n
(antioxidants)  are  added  to  foods  containing
fats and oil. Keeping food in air tight containers
helps  to  slow  down  oxidation.  Do  you  know
that chips manufacturers usually ﬂush bags of
chips with gas such as nitrogen to prevent the
chips from getting oxidised ?

1.   Why does the colour of copper sulphate

solution  change  when  an  iron  nail  is

dipped in it?

2 .   G i v e   a n   e x a m p l e   o f   a   d o u b l e

displacement  reaction  other  than  the

one given in Activity 1.10.

3.   Identify the substances that are oxidised

and the substances that are reduced in

the following reactions.

(i)   4Na(s) + O (g) ® 2Na O(s)

natural  indicator,  turmeric  is  another  such
indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry
on a white cloth becomes reddish-brown when
soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed on it?
It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed
with plenty of water. You can also use synthetic
indicators  such  as  methyl  orange  and
phenolphthalein to test for acids and bases.

In  this  Chapter,  we  will  study  the
reactions  of  acids  and  bases,  how  acids  and
bases cancel out each other’s eﬀects and many
more interesting things that we use and see in
our day-to-day life.

You  have  learnt  in  your  previous  classes

that the sour and bitter tastes of food are
due  to  acids  and  bases,  respectively,
present in them.

        If someone in the family is suffering from
a problem of acidity after overeating, which of
the following would you suggest as a remedy–
lemon juice, vinegar or baking soda solution?

■ Which  property  did  you  think  of  while

choosing the remedy?

Surely  you  must  have  used  your
knowledge about the ability of acids and bases
to nullify each other’s effect.

Recall  how  we  tested  sour  and  bitter
substances without tasting them.

             You already know that acids are sour in

Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to the
division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus solution is
neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural materials like red
cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some ﬂowers such as Hydrangea, Petunia and
Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a solution. These are called acid-
base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.

1.  You have been provided with three test
tubes. One of them contains distilled water
and  the  other  two  contain  an  acidic
solution and a basic solution, respectively.
If you are given only red litmus paper, how
will you identify the contents of each test
tube?

2.1  UNDERSTANDING THE CHEMICAL
      PROPERTIES OF ACIDS AND BASES

2.1.1 Acids and Bases in the Laboratory

These  indicators  tell  us  whether  a
substance is acidic or basic by change in colour.
There  are  some  substances  whose  odour
changes  in  acidic  or  basic  media.  These  are
called olfactory indicators. Let us try out some
of these indicators.

1.  You have been provided with three test

tubes. One of them contains distilled water

and  the  other  two  contain  an  acidic

solution and a basic solution, respectively.

If you are given only red litmus paper, how

will you identify the contents of each test

tube?

2.1  UNDERSTANDING THE CHEMICAL

      PROPERTIES OF ACIDS AND BASES

2.1.1 Acids and Bases in the Laboratory

These  indicators  tell  us  whether  a

substance is acidic or basic by change in colour.

There  are  some  substances  whose  odour

changes  in  acidic  or  basic  media.  These  are

called olfactory indicators. Let us try out some

of these indicators.

■ Rinse both cloth strips with water and

again check their odour.
■ Note your observations.
■ Now take some dilute vanilla essence
and clove oil and check their odour.
■ Take some dilute HCl solution in one
test tube and dilute NaOH solution in
another.  Add  a  few  drops  of  dilute
vanilla essence to both test tubes and
shake  well.  Check  the  odour  once
again and record changes in odour, if
any.

■ Similarly, test the change in the odour
of clove oil with dilute HCl and dilute

Note  that  the  metal  in  the  above
reactions  displaces  hydrogen  atoms  from  the
acids as hydrogen gas and forms a compound
called a salt. Thus, the reaction of a metal with
an acid can be summarised as –

Acid + Metal ® Salt + Hydrogen gas

Can  you  now  write  the  equations  for  the
reactions you have observed?

■ Place a few pieces of granulated zinc

metal in a test tube.

■ Add  2  mL  of  sodium  hydroxide
solution and warm the contents of the
test tube.

■ Repeat  the  rest  of  the  steps  as  in
A c t i v i t y   2 . 3   a n d   r e c o r d   y o u r
observations.

■ Take  two  test  tubes,  label  them  as A

and B.

■ Take about 0.5 g of sodium carbonate
(Na CO )  in  test  tube  A  and  about
0.5  g  of  sodium  hydrogencarbonate
(NaHCO ) in test tube B.

2

3

3

■ Add about 2 mL of dilute HCl to both

the test tubes.

■ What do you observe?
■ Pass  the  gas  produced  in  each  case
t h r o u g h   l i m e   w a t e r   ( c a l c i u m
hydroxide  solution)  as  shown  in
Fig. 2.2 and record your observations.

The reactions occurring in the above Activity
are written as –

The reaction that takes place can be written as
follows.

Test tube A:

Limestone,  chalk  and  marble  are
different forms of calcium carbonate. All metal
carbonates and hydrogencarbonates react with
acids  to  give  a  corresponding  salt,  carbon
dioxide and water.

Thus, the reaction can be summarised as –

Metal  carbonate/Metal  hydrogencarbonate  +
Acid ® Salt + Carbon dioxide + Water

2.1.4  How  do Acids  and  Bases  React  with
each other?

■ Take  about  2  mL  of  dilute  NaOH
solution  in  a  test  tube  and  add  two
drops of phenolphthalein solution.
■ What is the colour of the solution?
■ Add dilute HCl solution to the above

solution drop by drop.

■ Is  there  any  colour  change  for  the

reaction mixture?

■ Why did the colour of phenolphthalein
change after the addition of an acid?
■ Now add a few drops of NaOH to the

above mixture.

■ D o e s   t h e   p i n k   c o l o u r   o f

phenolphthalein reappear?

■ Why do you think this has happened?

     In the above Activity, we have observed that
the ef fect of a base is nulliﬁed by an acid and
vice-versa. The reaction taking place is written
as –

NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) ® NaCl(aq) + H O(l)

2

     The reaction between an acid and a base to
give  a  salt  and  water  is  known  as  a
neutralisation  reaction.  In  general,  a
neutralisation reaction can be written as –

Base + Acid ® Salt + Water

2.1.5  Reaction of Metallic Oxides with Acids

■ Take a small amount of copper oxide in
a  beaker  and  add  dilute  hydrochloric
acid slowly while stirring.

■ Note the colour of the solution. What
has happened to the copper oxide?

     You will notice that the colour of the solution
becomes  blue-green  and  the  copper  oxide
dissolves. The blue-green colour of the solution
is due to the formation of copper(II) chloride in
the  reaction.  The  general  reaction  between  a
metal oxide and an acid can be written as –

Metal oxide + Acid ® Salt + Water

give  a  salt  and  water  is  known  as  a

neutralisation  reaction.  In  general,  a

neutralisation reaction can be written as –

Acid ® Salt + Carbon dioxide + Water

Base + Acid ® Salt + Water

2.1.5  Reaction of Metallic Oxides with Acids

2.1.4  How  do Acids  and  Bases  React  with

each other?

■ Take  about  2  mL  of  dilute  NaOH

acid slowly while stirring.

■ Take a small amount of copper oxide in

a  beaker  and  add  dilute  hydrochloric

■ Note the colour of the solution. What

has happened to the copper oxide?

     You will notice that the colour of the solution

becomes  blue-green  and  the  copper  oxide

dissolves. The blue-green colour of the solution

is due to the formation of copper(II) chloride in

the  reaction.  The  general  reaction  between  a

Metal oxide + Acid ® Salt + Water

solution  in  a  test  tube  and  add  two

drops of phenolphthalein solution.

■ What is the colour of the solution?

■ Add dilute HCl solution to the above

solution drop by drop.

■ Is  there  any  colour  change  for  the

reaction mixture?

■ Why did the colour of phenolphthalein

change after the addition of an acid?

above mixture.

■ D o e s   t h e   p i n k   c o l o u r   o f

phenolphthalein reappear?

■ Why do you think this has happened?

■ Now add a few drops of NaOH to the

metal oxide and an acid can be written as –

now  write  and  balance  the  equation  for  the
above reaction. Since metallic oxides react with
acids  to  give  salts  and  water,  similar  to  the
reaction of a base with an acid, metallic oxides
are said to be basic oxides.

2.1.6 Reaction of a Non-metallic Oxide with
Base

You saw the reaction between carbon dioxide
and calcium hydroxide (lime water) in Activity
2.5. Calcium hydroxide, which is a base, reacts
with carbon dioxide to produce a salt and water.
Since this is similar to the reaction between a
base  and  an  acid,  we  can  conclude  that  non-
metallic oxides are acidic in nature.

2.2  WHAT  DO  ALL  ACIDS  AND  ALL
BASES  HAVE  IN  COMMON?

In Section 2.1 we have seen that all acids
have similar chemical properties. What leads to
this similarity in properties? We saw in Activity
2.3  that  all  acids  generate  hydrogen  gas  on
reacting with metals, so hydrogen seems to be
common to all acids. Let us perform an Activity
to  investigate  whether  all  compounds
containing hydrogen are acidic.

1.Why  should  curd  and  sour  substances
not be kept in brass and copper vessels?

2.  Which gas is usually liberated when an
acid reacts with a metal? Illustrate with
an example. How will you test for the
presence of  this gas?

3.  Metal  compound A  reacts  with  dilute
h y d r o c h l o r i c   a c i d   t o   p r o d u c e
effervescence.  The  gas  evolved
extinguishes a burning candle. Write a
balanced  chemical  equation  for  the
reaction  if  one  of  the  compounds
formed is calcium chloride.

The bulb will start glowing in the case of
acids,  as  shown  in  Fig.  2.3.  But  you  will
observe that glucose and alcohol solutions do
not  conduct  electricity.  Glowing  of  the  bulb
indicates that there is a ﬂow of electric current
through  the  solution.  The  electric  current  is
carried through the acidic solution by ions.

Acids contain H  ion as cation and anion
such as Cl  in HCl, NO  in   HNO , SO  in
3
H SO ,  CH COO   in  CH COOH.  Since  the
cation present in acids is H , this suggests that
acids  produce  hydrogen  ions,  H (aq),  in
solution, which are responsible for their acidic
properties.

Repeat the same Activity using alkalis
such as sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide,
etc. What can you conclude from the results of
this Activity?

2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a
Water  Solution?
Do  acids  produce  ions  only  in  aqueous
solution? Let us test this.

Figure 2.4 Preparation of HCl gas

50

■ Take  about  1g  solid  NaCl  in  a  clean
and  dry  test  tube  and  set  up  the
apparatus as shown in Fig. 2.4.

■ Add some concentrated sulphuric acid

to the test tube.

■ What  do  you  observe?  Is  there  a  gas

coming out of the delivery tube?

■ Test the gas evolved successively with

dry and wet blue litmus paper.

■ In  which  case  does  the  litmus  paper

change colour?

■ On  the  basis  of  the  above  Activity,
what  do  you  infer  about  the  acidic
character of:

(i)  dry HCl gas
(ii) HCl solution?

Note  to  teachers:  If  the  climate  is  very
humid,  you  will  have  to  pass  the  gas
produced  through  a  guard  tube  (drying
tube) containing calcium chloride to dry
the gas.

This experiment suggests that hydrogen
ions  in  HCl  are  produced  in  the  presence  of
water.  The  separation  of  H   ion  from  HCl
molecules cannot occur in the absence of water.

Hydrogen  ions  cannot  exist  alone,  but
they  exist  after  combining  with  water
molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be
shown as H (aq) or hydronium ion (H O ).

in the Table 2.1 are alkalis?

+

        Now  as  we  have  identiﬁed  that  all  acids
generate H (aq) and all bases generate OH (aq),
we  can  view  the  neutralisation  reaction  as
follows –

–

Acid + Base ® Salt + Water

H  X + M  OH ® MX + HOH

+

–
H (aq) + OH  (aq) ® H O(l)

Let us see what is involved when water is mixed
with an acid or a base.

■ Take 10 mL water in a beaker.

■ Add  a  few  drops  of  concentrated

H SO  to it and swirl the beaker slowly.

2

4

■ Touch the base of the beaker.

■ Is there a change in temperature?

■ Is this an exothermic or endothermic

process?

■ Repeat the above Activity with sodium

hydroxide  pellets  and  record  your

observations.

     The process of dissolving an acid or a base in
water is a highly exothermic one. Care must be
taken while mixing concentrated nitric acid or
sulphuric  acid  with  water.  The  acid  must
always be added slowly to water with constant
stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,
the  heat  generated  may  cause  the  mixture  to
splash out and cause burns. The glass container
may also break due to excessive local heating.
Look out for the warning sign (shown in Fig.
2.5) on the can of concentrated sulphuric acid
and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets.

+

      Mixing an acid or base with water results in
decrease  in  the  concentration  of  ions
(H O /OH ) per unit volume. Such a process is
called dilution and the acid or the base is said to
be diluted.

2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE
SOLUTIONS?
     We know how acid-base indicators can be
used to distinguish between an acid and a base.
We  have  also  learnt  in  the  previous  section
about dilution and decrease in concentration of
H   or  OH   ions  in  solutions.  Can  we
quantitatively  ﬁnd  the  amount  of  these  ions
present in a solution? Can we judge how strong
a given acid or base is?
     We can do this by making use of a universal
indicator,  which  is  a  mixture  of  several
indicators.  The  universal  indicator  shows
different colours at different concentrations of
hydrogen ions in a solution.
      A  scale  for  measuring  hydrogen  ion
concentration in a solution, called pH scale has
been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’
in German, meaning power. On the pH scale we
can measure pH generally from 0 (very acidic)
to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of
simply as a number which indicates the acidic
or  basic  nature  of  a  solution.  Higher  the
hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH
value.
             The pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values
less than 7 on the pH scale represent an acidic
solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to
14,  it  represents  an  increase  in  OH   ion
concentration in the solution, that is, increase in
the strength of alkali (Fig. 2.6). Generally paper
impregnated  with  the  universal  indicator  is
used for measuring pH.

6.  How is the concentration of hydroxide

2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE

SOLUTIONS?

     We know how acid-base indicators can be

used to distinguish between an acid and a base.

We  have  also  learnt  in  the  previous  section

about dilution and decrease in concentration of

+

–

H   or  OH   ions  in  solutions.  Can  we

quantitatively  ﬁnd  the  amount  of  these  ions

present in a solution? Can we judge how strong

a given acid or base is?

     We can do this by making use of a universal

indicator,  which  is  a  mixture  of  several

indicators.  The  universal  indicator  shows

different colours at different concentrations of

hydrogen ions in a solution.

      A  scale  for  measuring  hydrogen  ion

been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’

in German, meaning power. On the pH scale we

can measure pH generally from 0 (very acidic)

to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of

simply as a number which indicates the acidic

or  basic  nature  of  a  solution.  Higher  the

hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH

             The pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values

less than 7 on the pH scale represent an acidic

solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to

14,  it  represents  an  increase  in  OH   ion

–

concentration in the solution, that is, increase in

the strength of alkali (Fig. 2.6). Generally paper

impregnated  with  the  universal  indicator  is

used for measuring pH.

recommended that the acid should be

2.3.1 Importance of pH in Everyday Life
Are plants and animals pH sensitive?

Our body works within the pH range of
7.0 to 7.8. Living organisms can survive only in
a narrow range of pH change. When pH of rain
water  is  less  than  5.6,  it  is  called  acid  rain.
When acid rain ﬂows into the rivers, it lowers
the  pH  of  the  river  water.  The  survival  of
aquatic life in such rivers becomes difficult.

     The strength of acids and bases depends on
the number of H  ions and OH  ions produced,
respectively. If we take hydrochloric acid and
acetic acid of the same concentration, say one
molar, then these produce different amounts of
+
hydrogen ions. Acids that give rise to more H
ions are said to be strong acids, and acids that
give less H ions are said to be weak acids. Can
you now say what weak and strong bases are?

pH in our digestive system

It  is  very  interesting  to  note  that  our
stomach produces hydrochloric acid. It helps in
the  digestion  of  food  without  harming  the
stomach.  During  indigestion  the  stomach
produces  too  much  acid  and  this  causes  pain
and irritation. To get rid of this pain, people use
bases called antacids. One such remedy must
have been suggested by you at the beginning of
this  Chapter.  These  antacids  neutralise  the
excess  acid.  Magnesium  hydroxide  (Milk  of
magnesia), a mild base, is often used for this
purpose.
pH change as the cause of tooth decay

Tooth decay starts when the pH of the
mouth is lower than 5.5. Tooth enamel, made up
of calcium hydroxyapatite (a crystalline form
of calcium phosphate) is the hardest substance
in the body. It does not dissolve in water, but is
corroded when the pH in the mouth is below
5.5.  Bacteria  present  in  the  mouth  produce
acids by degradation of sugar and food particles
remaining in the mouth after eating. The best
way to prevent this is to clean the mouth after
eating  food.  Using  toothpastes,  which  are
generally  basic,  for  cleaning  the  teeth  can
neutralise  the  excess  acid  and  prevent  tooth
decay.
Self defence by animals and plants through
chemical warfare

Have you ever been stung by a honey-
bee?  Bee-sting  leaves  an  acid  which    causes
pain  and  irritation.  Use  of  a  mild  base  like
baking  soda  on  the  stung  area  gives  relief.
Stinging hair of nettle leaves inject methanoic
acid causing burning pain.

Acids in other planets
The  atmosphere  of  venus  is  made  up  of
thick  white  and  yellowish  clouds  of
sulphuric acid. Do you think life can exist
on this planet?

What is the pH of the soil in your backyard?

Plants  require  a  speciﬁc  pH  range  for
their  healthy  growth.  To  ﬁnd  out  the  pH
required for the healthy growth of a plant, you
can  collect  the  soil  from  various  places  and
check the pH in the manner described below in
Activity 2.12. Also, you can note down which
plants  are  growing  in  the  region  from  which
you have collected the soil.

■ Put about 2 g soil in a test tube and add

5 mL water to it.

■ Shake the contents of the test tube.

■ Filter  the  contents  and  collect  the

ﬁltrate in a test tube.

■ Check the pH of this ﬁltrate with the

help of universal indicator paper.

■ What can you conclude about the ideal

soil pH for the growth of plants in your

region?

Nature provides neutralisation options
Nettle is a herbaceous plant which grows in the wild. Its leaves have stinging hair, which
cause painful stings when touched accidentally. This is due to the methanoic acid secreted by
them. A traditional remedy is rubbing the area with the leaf of the dock
plant, which often grows beside the nettle in the wild. Can you guess
the nature of the dock plant? So next time you know what to look out
for if you accidentally touch a nettle plant while trekking. Are you
aware of any other effective traditional remedies for such stings?

Nature provides neutralisation options

Nettle is a herbaceous plant which grows in the wild. Its leaves have stinging hair, which

cause painful stings when touched accidentally. This is due to the methanoic acid secreted by

them. A traditional remedy is rubbing the area with the leaf of the dock

plant, which often grows beside the nettle in the wild. Can you guess

the nature of the dock plant? So next time you know what to look out

for if you accidentally touch a nettle plant while trekking. Are you

aware of any other effective traditional remedies for such stings?

2.4.3 Chemicals from Common Salt

By  now  you  have  learnt  that  the  salt
formed  by  the  combination  of  hydrochloric
acid  and  sodium  hydroxide  solution  is  called
sodium chloride. This is the salt that you use in
food.  You  must  have  observed  in  the  above
Activity that it is a neutral salt.

Seawater contains many salts dissolved
in it. Sodium chloride is separated from these
salts.  Deposits  of  solid  salt  are  also  found  in
several parts of the world. These large crystals
are often brown due to impurities. This is called
rock salt. Beds of rock salt were formed when
seas  of  bygone  ages  dried  up.  Rock  salt  is
mined like coal.

You  must  have  heard  about  Mahatma
Gandhi’s  Dandi  March.  Did  you  know  that
sodium chloride was such an important symbol
in our struggle for freedom?

■ Identify the acids and bases from which

the above salts may be obtained.

■ Salts  having  the  same  positive  or
negative radicals are said to belong to a
family.  For example, NaCl and Na SO
4
belong  to  the  family  of  sodium  salts.
Similarly, NaCl and KCl belong to the
family  of  chloride  salts.    How  many
families  can  you  identify  among  the
salts given in this Activity?

2

2.4.2 pH of Salts

■ Collect  the  following  salt  samples  –
sodium  chloride,  potassium  nitrate,
aluminium  chloride,  zinc  sulphate,
copper  sulphate,  sodium  acetate,
s o d i u m   c a r b o n a t e   a n d   s o d i u m
hydrogencarbonate  (some  other  salts
available can also be taken).

■ Check  their  solubility  in  water  (use

distilled water only).

■ Check the action of these solutions on
litmus and ﬁnd the pH using a pH paper.
■ Which of the salts are acidic, basic or

neutral?

■ Identify the acid or base used to form

the salt.

■ Report your observations in Table 2.4.

Salts of a strong acid and a strong base
are  neutral  with  pH  value  of  7.  On  the  other
hand, salts of a strong acid and weak base are
acidic with pH value less than 7 and those of a
strong base and weak acid are basic in nature,
with pH value more than 7.

Common  salt  —  A  raw  material  for
chemicals
The common salt thus obtained is an important
raw material for various materials of daily use,
such  as  sodium  hydroxide,  baking  soda,
washing  soda,  bleaching  powder  and  many
more. Let us see how one substance is used for
making all these different substances.
Sodium hydroxide
When electricity is passed through an aqueous
solution  of  sodium  chloride  (called  brine),  it
decomposes  to  form  sodium  hydroxide.  The
process  is  called  the  chlor-alkali  process
because  of  the  products  formed–  chlor  for
chlorine and alkali for sodium hydroxide.

Bleaching powder

You have already come to know that chlorine is
produced  during  the  electrolysis  of  aqueous
sodium  chloride  (brine).  This  chlorine  gas  is
used for the manufacture of bleaching powder.
Bleaching powder is produced by the action of
chlorine  on  dry  slaked  lime  [Ca(OH) ].
Bleaching  powder  is  represented  as  CaOCl , 2
though  the  actual  composition  is  quite
complex.

       What  does  10H O  signify?  Does  it  make
Na CO  wet? We will address this question in

hydrogencarbonate  are  useful  chemicals  for
many industrial processes as well.

Uses of washing soda

(i)  Sodium carbonate (washing soda) is

used in glass, soap and paper industries.

(ii)  It is used in the manufacture of sodium

 compounds such as borax.

(iii) Sodium carbonate can be used as a

 cleaning agent for domestic purposes.

(iv) It is used for removing permanent

 hardness of water.

2.4.4  Are the Crystals of Salts really Dry?

Figure 2.9
Removing water of crystallisation

68

■ Heat a few crystals of copper sulphate

in a dry boiling tube.

■ What  is  the  colour  of  the  copper

sulphate after heating?

■ Do  you  notice  water  droplets  in  the
boiling  tube? Where  have  these  come
from?

■ Add 2-3 drops of   water on the sample
of  copper  sulphate  obtained  after
heating.

■ What do you observe? Is the blue colour

of copper sulphate restored?

      Copper sulphate crystals which seem to be
dry contain water of crystallisation. When we
heat the crystals, this water is removed and the
salt turns white.

If  you  moisten  the  crystals  again  with
water,  you  will  ﬁnd  that  blue  colour  of  the
crystals reappears.
      Water of crystallisation is the ﬁxed number
of water molecules present in one formula unit
of a salt. Five water molecules are present in
one formula unit of copper sulphate. Chemical
formula for hydrated copper sulphate is CuSO . 4
5H O. Now you would be able to answer the
q u e s t i o n   w h e t h e r   t h e   m o l e c u l e   o f
Na CO .10H O is wet.
        One  other  salt,  which  possesses  water  of
crystallisation  is  gypsum.  It  has  two  water
molecules as water of cyrstallisation. It has the
chemical  formula  CaSO .2H O.  Let  us  look
into the use of this salt.

On  heating  gypsum  at  373  K,  it  loses
water molecules and becomes calcium sulphate
hemihydrate (             ). This is called Plaster of

       What  does  10H O  signify?  Does  it  make

many industrial processes as well.

Uses of washing soda

(i)  Sodium carbonate (washing soda) is

(ii)  It is used in the manufacture of sodium

 compounds such as borax.

(iii) Sodium carbonate can be used as a

 cleaning agent for domestic purposes.

(iv) It is used for removing permanent

 hardness of water.

2.4.4  Are the Crystals of Salts really Dry?

used in glass, soap and paper industries.

from?

■ Heat a few crystals of copper sulphate

in a dry boiling tube.

■ What  is  the  colour  of  the  copper

sulphate after heating?

■ Do  you  notice  water  droplets  in  the

boiling  tube? Where  have  these  come

■ Add 2-3 drops of   water on the sample

of  copper  sulphate  obtained  after

heating.

■ What do you observe? Is the blue colour

of copper sulphate restored?

      Copper sulphate crystals which seem to be

dry contain water of crystallisation. When we

heat the crystals, this water is removed and the

salt turns white.

If  you  moisten  the  crystals  again  with

water,  you  will  ﬁnd  that  blue  colour  of  the

crystals reappears.

      Water of crystallisation is the ﬁxed number

of water molecules present in one formula unit

of a salt. Five water molecules are present in

one formula unit of copper sulphate. Chemical

formula for hydrated copper sulphate is CuSO . 4

5H O. Now you would be able to answer the

q u e s t i o n   w h e t h e r   t h e   m o l e c u l e   o f

Na CO .10H O is wet.

        One  other  salt,  which  possesses  water  of

crystallisation  is  gypsum.  It  has  two  water

molecules as water of cyrstallisation. It has the

chemical  formula  CaSO .2H O.  Let  us  look

4

2

2

2

into the use of this salt.

Plaster of Paris

On  heating  gypsum  at  373  K,  it  loses

water molecules and becomes calcium sulphate

hemihydrate (             ). This is called Plaster of

CaSO     . 2H O

Paris,  the  substance  which  doctors  use  as
plaster  for  supporting  fractured  bones  in  the
right position. Plaster of Paris is a white powder
and on mixing with water, it changes to gypsum
once again giving a hard solid mass.

Note that only half a water molecule is
shown to be attached as water of crystallisation.
How can you get half a water molecule? It is
written in this form because two formula units
of CaSO  share one molecule of water. Plaster
of Paris is used for making toys, materials for
decoration  and  for  making  surfaces  smooth.
Try  to  ﬁnd  out  why  is  calcium  sulphate

8.  Why do acids not show acidic behaviour in the absence of water?
9.  Five solutions A,B,C,D and E when tested with universal indicator showed pH

 as 4,1,11,7 and 9, respectively. Which solution is
(a)  neutral?
(b)  strongly alkaline?
(c)  strongly acidic?
(d)  weakly acidic?
(e)  weakly alkaline?
Arrange the pH in increasing order of hydrogen-ion concentration.

10.  Equal lengths of magnesium ribbons are taken in test tubes A and B. Hydrochloric acid
(HCl) is added to test tube A, while acetic acid (CH COOH) is added to test tube B.
Amount and concentration taken for both the acids are same. In which test tube will the
ﬁzzing occur more vigorously and why?

11.  Fresh milk has a pH of 6. How do you think the pH will change as it turns into curd?

Explain your answer.

12.  A milkman adds a very small amount of baking soda to fresh milk.

(a)  Why does he shift the pH of the fresh milk from 6 to slightly alkaline?
(b)  Why does this milk take a long time to set as curd?

13.  Plaster of  Paris should be stored in a moisture-proof container. Explain why?
14.  What is a neutralisation reaction? Give two examples.
15.  Give two important uses of  washing soda and baking soda.

(I) Prepare your own indicator
■ Crush beetroot in a mortar.
■ Add sufficient water to obtain the extract.
■ Filter the extract by the procedure learnt by you in earlier classes.
■ Collect the ﬁltrate to test the substances you may have tasted earlier.
■ Arrange  four  test  tubes  in  a  test  tube  stand  and  label  them  as A,B,C  and  D.  Pour
2 mL each of lemon juice solution, soda-water, vinegar and baking soda solution in
them respectively.

■ Put 2-3 drops of the beetroot extract in each test tube and note the colour change if any.

Write your observation in a Table.

■ You  can  prepare  indicators  by  using  other  natural  materials  like  extracts  of  red

8.  Why do acids not show acidic behaviour in the absence of water?

9.  Five solutions A,B,C,D and E when tested with universal indicator showed pH

 as 4,1,11,7 and 9, respectively. Which solution is

(a)  neutral?

(b)  strongly alkaline?

(c)  strongly acidic?

(d)  weakly acidic?

(e)  weakly alkaline?

Arrange the pH in increasing order of hydrogen-ion concentration.

10.  Equal lengths of magnesium ribbons are taken in test tubes A and B. Hydrochloric acid

(HCl) is added to test tube A, while acetic acid (CH COOH) is added to test tube B.

3

Amount and concentration taken for both the acids are same. In which test tube will the

ﬁzzing occur more vigorously and why?

11.  Fresh milk has a pH of 6. How do you think the pH will change as it turns into curd?

Explain your answer.

12.  A milkman adds a very small amount of baking soda to fresh milk.

(a)  Why does he shift the pH of the fresh milk from 6 to slightly alkaline?

(b)  Why does this milk take a long time to set as curd?

13.  Plaster of  Paris should be stored in a moisture-proof container. Explain why?

14.  What is a neutralisation reaction? Give two examples.

15.  Give two important uses of  washing soda and baking soda.

(I) Prepare your own indicator

■ Crush beetroot in a mortar.

■ Add sufficient water to obtain the extract.

■ Filter the extract by the procedure learnt by you in earlier classes.

■ Collect the ﬁltrate to test the substances you may have tasted earlier.

■ Arrange  four  test  tubes  in  a  test  tube  stand  and  label  them  as A,B,C  and  D.  Pour

2 mL each of lemon juice solution, soda-water, vinegar and baking soda solution in

■ Put 2-3 drops of the beetroot extract in each test tube and note the colour change if any.

them respectively.

Write your observation in a Table.

■ You  can  prepare  indicators  by  using  other  natural  materials  like  extracts  of  red

cabbage  leaves,  coloured  petals  of  some  ﬂowers  such  as  Petunia,  Hydrangea  and

Geranium.

(II) Preparing a soda-acid ﬁre extinguisher
■ The reaction of acids with metal hydrogencarbonates is used in the ﬁre extinguishers

which produce carbon dioxide.

■ Take 20 mL of sodium hydrogencarbonate (NaHCO ) solution in a wash-bottle.
■ Suspend  an  ignition  tube  containing  dilute  sulphuric  acid  in  the  wash-bottle

3

(Fig. 2.10).

■ Close the mouth of the wash-bottle.
■ Tilt the wash-bottle so that the acid from the ignition tube mixes with the sodium

hydrogencarbonate solution below.

■ You will notice discharge coming out of the nozzle.
■ Direct this discharge on a burning candle. What happens?

basis of their properties.

Ielements. You have seen that elements can

• Think of some uses of metals and non-metals

in your daily life.

• What  properties  did  you  think  of  while
categorising  elements  as  metals  or  non-
metals?

• How are these properties related to the uses of
these elements? Let us look at some of these
properties in detail.

■ Take  small  pieces  of  iron,  copper,
aluminium,  and  magnesium. Try  to  cut
these metals with a sharp knife and note
your observations.

■ Hold a piece of sodium metal with a pair

of tongs.

CAUTION: Always handle sodium metal
with care. Dry it by pressing between the
folds of a ﬁlter paper.

■ Put it on a watch-glass and try to cut it

The  easiest  way  to  start  grouping
substances  is  by  comparing  their  physical
properties. Let us study this with the help of the
following activities. For performing Activities
3.1  to  3.6,  collect  the  samples  of  following
metals – iron, copper, aluminium, magnesium,
sodium, lead, zinc and any other metal that is
easily available.

■ Ta k e   s a m p l e s   o f     i r o n ,   c o p p e r,
aluminium  and  magnesium.  Note  the
appearance of each sample.

■ Clean  the  surface  of  each  sample  by
rubbing them with sand paper and note
their appearance again.

Metals,  in  their  pure  state,  have  a
shining surface. This property is called metallic
lustre.

■ What do you observe?

You will ﬁnd that metals are generally

hard. The hardness varies from metal to metal.

■ Take  pieces  of  iron,  zinc,  lead  and

■ Place any one metal on a block of iron
and  strike  it  four  or  ﬁve  times  with  a
hammer. What do you observe?

■ Repeat with other metals.

■ Record the change in the shape of these

metals.

You  will  ﬁnd  that  some  metals  can  be
beaten into thin sheets. This property is called
malleability. Did you know that gold and silver

3.1 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES

with a knife.

n  Class  IX  you  have  learnt  about  various

Ielements. You have seen that elements can

be classiﬁed as metals or non-metals on the

basis of their properties.

• Think of some uses of metals and non-metals

in your daily life.

• What  properties  did  you  think  of  while

categorising  elements  as  metals  or  non-

metals?

• How are these properties related to the uses of

these elements? Let us look at some of these

properties in detail.

The ability of metals to be drawn into thin
wires is called ductility. Gold is the most ductile
metal. You will be surprised to know that a wire
of about 2 km length can be drawn from one
gram of gold.

It  is  because  of  their  malleability  and
ductility  that  metals  can  be  given  different
shapes according to our needs.
  Can you name some metals that are used for
making  cooking  vessels?  Do  you  know  why
these metals are used for making vessels? Let
us  do  the  following  Activity  to  ﬁnd  out  the
answer.

The  above  activity  shows  that  metals  are
good conductors of heat and have high melting
points. The best conductors of heat are silver
a n d   c o p p e r.   L e a d   a n d   m e r c u r y   a r e
comparatively  poor conductors of heat.
  Do metals also conduct electricity? Let us
ﬁnd out.

■ Set up an electric circuit as shown in Fig.

3.2.

■ Place the metal to be tested in the circuit
between terminals A and B as shown.

■ Does  the  bulb  glow?  What  does  this

indicate?

Figure 3.1
Metals are good conductors of heat.

■ Take  an  aluminium  or  copper  wire.
Clamp this wire on a stand, as shown in
Fig. 3.1.

■ Fix a pin to the free end of the wire using

wax.

■ Heat the wire with a spirit lamp, candle or
a  burner  near  the  place  where  it  is
clamped.

■ What do you observe after some time?

■ Note your observations. Does the metal

wire melt?

Figure 3.2
Metals are good conductors of electricity.

  You must have seen that the wires that carry
current  in  your  homes  have  a  coating  of
polyvinylchloride  (PVC)  or  a  rubber-like
material.  Why  are  electric  wires  coated  with
such substances?
  What  happens  when  metals  strike  a  hard
surface? Do they produce a sound? The metals
that produce a sound on striking a hard surface
are said to be sonorous. Can you now say why
school bells are made of metals?

3.1.2 Non-metals

In  the  previous  Class  you  have  learnt  that
there are very few non-metals as compared to
metals. Some of the examples of non-metals are
carbon, sulphur, iodine, oxygen, hydrogen, etc.
The  non-metals  are  either    solids  or  gases
except bromine which is a liquid.

  Do non-metals also have physical properties
similar to that of metals? Let us ﬁnd out.

■ Collect  samples  of  carbon  (coal  or

graphite), sulphur and iodine.

■ Carry out the Activities 3.1 to 3.4 and 3.6
with  these  non-metals  and  record  your
observations.

  Compile  your  observations  regarding
metals and non-metals in Table 3.1.

  On the bases of the observations recorded in
Table  3.1,  discuss  the  general  physical
properties  of  metals  and  non-metals  in  the
class. You must have concluded that we cannot
group  elements  according  to  their  physical
properties alone, as there are many exceptions.
For example –

(i) All metals except mercury exist as solids

at room temperature.

In  Activity  3.5,  you  have  observed  that
metals  have  high  melting  points  but  gallium
and  caesium  have  very  low  melting  points.
These two metals will melt if you keep them on
your palm.

(ii) Iodine is a non-metal but it is lustrous.

(iii) Carbon is a non-metal that can exist in
different  forms.  Each  form  is  called  an
allotrope. Diamond, an allotrope of carbon, is
the hardest natural substance known and has a
very high melting and boiling point. Graphite,
another allotrope of carbon, is a conductor of
electricity.

(iv)  Alkali  metals  (lithium,  sodium,

84

potassium) are so soft that they can be cut with a
knife. They have low densities and low melting
points.

  Elements can be more clearly classiﬁed as
metals and non-metals

■ Take  a  magnesium  ribbon  and  some

sulphur powder.

■ Burn the magnesium ribbon. Collect the
ashes  formed  and  dissolve    them  in
water.

■ Test the resultant solution with both red

and blue litmus paper.

■ Is  the  product  formed  on  burning

magnesium acidic or basic?

■ Now  burn  sulphur  powder.  Place  a  test
tube over the burning sulphur to collect
the fumes produced.

■ Add  some  water  to  the  above  test  tube

and shake.

■ Test this solution with blue and red litmus

■ Is the product formed on burning sulphur

acidic or basic?

■ Can  you  write  equations  for  these

reactions?

  Most  non-metals  produce  acidic  oxides
when dissolve in water. On the other hand, most
metals, give rise to basic oxides. You will be
learning more about these metal oxides in the
next section.

1.  Give an example of a metal which
(i) is a liquid at room temperature.
(ii) can be easily cut with a knife.
(iii) is the best conductor of heat.
(iv) is a poor conductor of heat.

  We will learn about the chemical properties
of  metals  in  the  following  Sections  3.2.1  to
3.2.4. For this, collect the samples of following
metals  –  aluminium,  copper,  iron,  lead,
magnesium, zinc and sodium.

3.2.1 What happens when Metals are burnt
in Air?

  You  have  seen  in  Activity  3.8  that
magnesium burns in air with a dazzling white
ﬂame. Do all metals react in the same manner?
Let  us  check  by  performing  the  following
Activity.

86

■ CAUTION: The following activity needs
the  teacher’s  assistance.  It  would  be
better if students wear eye protection.

■ Hold  any  of  the  samples  taken  above
with a pair of tongs and try burning over a
ﬂame.  Repeat  with  the  other  metal
samples.

■ Collect the product if formed.

■ Let  the  products  and  the  metal  surface

cool down.

■ Which metals burn easily?

■ What ﬂame colour did you observe when

the metal burnt?

■ How does the metal surface appear after

burning?

■ Arrange  the  metals  in  the  decreasing
order of their reactivity towards oxygen.

■ Are the products soluble in water?

  Almost all metals combine with oxygen to
form metal oxides.
  Metal  +  Oxygen ® Metal oxide
  For example, when copper is heated in air, it
combines  with  oxygen  to  form  copper(II)
oxide, a black oxide.

2Cu  +  O   ®  2CuO
2

         (Copper(II) oxide)
       (Copper)
Similarly, aluminium forms aluminium oxide.

  Recall  from  Chapter  2,  how  copper  oxide
reacts with hydrochloric acid. We have learnt
that metal oxides are basic in nature. But some
metal  oxides,  such  as  aluminium  oxide,  zinc
oxide  show  both  acidic  as  well  as  basic

behaviour. Such metal oxides which react with
both acids as well as bases to produce salts and
water  are  known  as  amphoteric  oxides.
Aluminium  oxide  reacts  in  the  following
manner with acids and bases –
  Al O  + 6HCl ® 2AlCl  + 3H O
  Al O  + 2NaOH ® 2NaAlO  + H O

                    aluminate)

  Most metal oxides are insoluble in water but
some of these dissolve in water to form alkalis.
Sodium oxide and potassium oxide dissolve in
water to produce alkalis as follows –

  Na O(s) + H O(l) ® 2NaOH(aq)

  K O(s) + H O(l) ® 2KOH(aq)

  We  have  observed  in Activity  3.9  that  all
metals  do  not  react  with  oxygen  at  the  same
rate.  Diﬀerent  metals  show  diﬀerent
reactivities  towards  oxygen.  Metals  such  as
potassium and sodium react so vigorously that
they  catch  ﬁre  if  kept  in  the  open.  Hence,  to
protect  them  and  to  prevent  accidental  ﬁres,
they  are  kept  immersed  in  kerosene  oil.  At
ordinary  temperature,  the  surfaces  of  metals
such as magnesium, aluminium, zinc, lead, etc.,
are  covered  with  a  thin  layer  of  oxide.  The
protective oxide layer prevents the metal from
further oxidation. Iron does not burn on heating
but iron ﬁlings burn vigorously when sprinkled
in  the  ﬂame  of  the  burner.  Copper  does  not
burn, but the hot metal is coated with a black
coloured layer of copper(II) oxide. Silver and
gold  do  not  react  with  oxygen  even  at  high
temperatures.

Anodising is a process of forming a thick oxide layer of aluminium. Aluminium develops a thin
oxide  layer  when  exposed  to  air.  This  aluminium  oxide  coat  makes  it  resistant  to  further
corrosion.  The resistance can be improved further by making the oxide layer thicker.  During
anodising,  a  clean  aluminium  article  is  made  the  anode  and  is  electrolysed  with  dilute
sulphuric acid. The oxygen gas evolved at the anode reacts with aluminium to make a thicker
protective oxide layer.   This oxide layer can be dyed easily to give aluminium articles an
attractive ﬁnish.

  After  performing  Activity  3.9,  you  must
have observed that sodium is the most reactive
of  the  samples  of  metals  taken  here.  The
reaction  of  magnesium  is  less  vigorous
implying that it is not as reactive as sodium. But
burning in oxygen does not help us to decide
about the reactivity of zinc, iron, copper or lead.
Let us see some more reactions to arrive at a
conclusion about the order of reactivity of these
metals.

3.2.2 What happens when Metals react with
Water?

CAUTION:  This  Activity  needs  the
teacher’s assistance.

■ Collect the samples of the same metals as

in Activity 3.9.

■ Put  small  pieces  of  the  samples
separately in beakers half-ﬁlled with cold
water.

■ Which  metals  reacted  with  cold  water?
Arrange them in the increasing order of
their reactivity with cold water.

■ Did any metal produce ﬁre on water?

■ Does any metal start ﬂoating after some

time?

■ Put the metals that did not react with cold
water  in  beakers  half  -  ﬁlled  with  hot
water.

■ For the metals that did not react with hot
water, arrange the apparatus as shown in
Fig. 3.3 and observe their reaction with
steam.

■ Which  metals  did  not  react  even  with

steam?

■ Arrange  the  metals  in  the  decreasing

order of reactivity with water.

  Metals  react  with  water  and  produce  a
metal  oxide  and  hydrogen  gas.  Metal  oxides
that are soluble in water dissolve in it to further
form  metal  hydroxide.  But  all  metals  do  not
react with water.
  Metal + Water ® Metal oxide + Hydrogen
  Metal oxide + Water ® Metal hydroxide
  Metals  like  potassium  and  sodium  react
violently with cold water. In case of sodium and
potassium,  the  reaction  is  so  violent  and
exothermic  that  the  evolved  hydrogen
immediately catches ﬁre.

 2K(s) + 2H O(l) ® 2KOH(aq) + H (g) + heat energy
2Na(s) + 2H O(l) ® 2NaOH(aq) + H (g) + heat energy

2

2

2

2

The reaction of calcium with water is less
violent. The heat evolved is not suﬃcient for
the hydrogen to catch ﬁre.

     Ca(s) + 2H O(l) ® Ca(OH) (aq) + H (g)

2

2

2

  Calcium starts ﬂoating because the bubbles
of hydrogen gas formed stick to the surface of
the metal.
  Magnesium does not react with cold water.
It  reacts  with  hot  water  to  form  magnesium
hydroxide and hydrogen. It also starts ﬂoating
due to the bubbles of hydrogen gas sticking to
its surface.

3.2.3 What happens when Metals react with
Acids?
  You  have  already  learnt  that  metals  react
with acids to give a salt and hydrogen gas.
  Metal + Dilute acid ® Salt + Hydrogen
  But do all metals react in the same manner?
Let us ﬁnd out.

■ Collect  all  the  metal  samples  except
sodium  and  potassium  again.  If  the
samples  are  tarnished,  rub  them  clean
with sand paper.

CAUTION:  Do  not  take  sodium  and
potassium as they react vigorously even
with cold water.

■ Put the samples separately in test tubes

containing dilute hydrochloric acid.

■ Suspend thermometers in the test tubes,
so that their bulbs are dipped in the acid.

■ Observe the rate of formation of bubbles

carefully.

■ Which  metals  reacted  vigorously  with

dilute hydrochloric acid?

■ With  which  metal  did  you  record  the

highest temperature?

2

  Write  equations  for  the  reactions  of
magnesium,  aluminium,  zinc  and  iron  with
dilute hydrochloric acid.
  Hydrogen gas is not evolved when a metal
reacts with nitric acid. It is because HNO  is a
strong  oxidising  agent.  It  oxidises  the  H  2
produced to water and itself gets reduced to any
of  the  nitrogen  oxides  (N O,  NO,  NO ).  But
magnesium  (Mg)  and  manganese  (Mn)  react
with very dilute HNO  to evolve H  gas.
  You  must  have  observed  in Activity  3.11,
that  the  rate  of  formation  of  bubbles  was  the
fastest in the case of magnesium. The reaction
was also the most exothermic in this case. The
reactivity decreases in the order Mg > Al > Zn >
Fe. In the case of copper, no bubbles were seen
and the temperature also remained unchanged.
This  shows  that  copper  does  not  react  with
dilute Hcl.

  Aqua regia, (Latin for ‘royal water’)
is  a  freshly  prepared  mixture  of
concentrated  hydrochloric  acid  and
concentrated  nitric  acid  in  the  ratio  of
3:1.  It  can  dissolve  gold,  even  though
neither  of  these  acids  can  do  so  alone.
Aqua regia is a highly corrosive, fuming
liquid. It is one of the few reagents that is
able to dissolve gold and platinum.

3.2.4 How do Metals react with Solutions of
other Metal Salts?

■ Take a clean wire of copper and an iron

■ Arrange  the  metals  in  the  decreasing

nail.

order of reactivity with dilute acids.

■ Put the copper wire in a solution of iron
sulphate and the iron nail in a solution of
copper sulphate taken in test tubes (Fig.
3.4).

3.2.3 What happens when Metals react with

Acids?

  You  have  already  learnt  that  metals  react

with acids to give a salt and hydrogen gas.

  Metal + Dilute acid ® Salt + Hydrogen

  But do all metals react in the same manner?

  You  must  have  observed  in Activity  3.11,

that  the  rate  of  formation  of  bubbles  was  the

fastest in the case of magnesium. The reaction

was also the most exothermic in this case. The

reactivity decreases in the order Mg > Al > Zn >

Fe. In the case of copper, no bubbles were seen

and the temperature also remained unchanged.

This  shows  that  copper  does  not  react  with

sodium  and  potassium  again.  If  the

samples  are  tarnished,  rub  them  clean

with sand paper.

CAUTION:  Do  not  take  sodium  and

potassium as they react vigorously even

with cold water.

■ Put the samples separately in test tubes

containing dilute hydrochloric acid.

■ Suspend thermometers in the test tubes,

so that their bulbs are dipped in the acid.

■ Observe the rate of formation of bubbles

carefully.

■ Which  metals  reacted  vigorously  with

dilute hydrochloric acid?

■ With  which  metal  did  you  record  the

order of reactivity with dilute acids.

  Aqua regia, (Latin for ‘royal water’)

is  a  freshly  prepared  mixture  of

concentrated  hydrochloric  acid  and

concentrated  nitric  acid  in  the  ratio  of

3:1.  It  can  dissolve  gold,  even  though

neither  of  these  acids  can  do  so  alone.

Aqua regia is a highly corrosive, fuming

liquid. It is one of the few reagents that is

able to dissolve gold and platinum.

3.2.4 How do Metals react with Solutions of

other Metal Salts?

■ Take a clean wire of copper and an iron

■ Put the copper wire in a solution of iron

sulphate and the iron nail in a solution of

copper sulphate taken in test tubes (Fig.

  Reactive  metals  can  displace  less  reactive
metals  from  their  compounds  in  solution  or
molten form.
  We have seen in the previous sections that
all metals are not equally reactive. We checked
the  reactivity  of  various  metals  with  oxygen,
water and acids. But all metals do not react with
these reagents. So we were not able to put all the
metal samples we had collected in decreasing
order  of  their  reactivity.  Displacement
reactions  studied  in  Chapter  1  give  better
evidence  about  the  reactivity  of  metals.  It  is
simple and easy if metal A displaces metal B
from its solution, it is more reactive than B.

3.3  HOW  DO  METALS  AND  NON-
METALS  REACT?

In the above activities, you saw the reactions
of metals with a number of reagents. Why do
metals react in this manner? Let us recall what
we learnt about the electronic conﬁguration of
elements  in  Class  IX.  We  learnt  that  noble
gases, which have a completely ﬁlled valence
shell,  show  little  chemical  activity.  We,
therefore, explain the reactivity of elements as a
tendency to attain a completely ﬁlled valence
shell.

  Let  us  have  a  look  at  the  electronic
conﬁguration of noble gases and some metals
and non-metals.
We can see from Table 3.3 that a sodium atom
has one electron in its outermost shell. If it loses
the electron from its M shell then its L shell now
becomes  the  outermost  shell  and  that  has  a
stable octet. The nucleus of this atom still has
11  protons  but  the  number  of  electrons  has
become  10,  so  there  is  a  net  positive  charge
giving us a sodium cation Na+. On the other
hand  chlorine  has  seven  electrons  in  its
outermost  shell  and  it  requires  one  more

electron  to  complete  its  octet.  If  sodium  and
chlorine  were  to  react,  the  electron  lost  by
sodium  could  be  taken  up  by  chlorine. After
gaining  an  electron,  the  chlorine  atom  gets  a
unit negative charge, because its nucleus has 17
protons and there are 18 electrons in its K, L and
M shells. This gives us a chloride anion C1 . So
both  these  elements  can  have  a  give-and-take
relation between them as follows (Fig. 3.5).

–

  Sodium and chloride ions, being oppositely
charged,  attract  each  other  and  are  held  by
strong electrostatic forces of attraction to exist
as sodium chloride (NaCl). It should be noted
that  sodium  chloride  does  not  exist  as
molecules but aggregates of oppositely charged
ions.
  Let us see the formation of one more ionic
compound, magnesium chloride (Fig. 3.6).

  The compounds formed in this manner by
the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-
metal  are  known  as  ionic  compounds  or
electrovalent  compounds.  Can  you  name  the
cation and anion present in MgCl ? 2

3.3.1 Properties of Ionic Compounds

  To  learn  about  the  properties  of  ionic
compounds,  let  us  perform  the  following
Activity:

■ Take  samples  of  sodium  chloride,
potassium iodide, barium chloride or any
other salt from the science laboratory.

■ What is the physical state of these salts?

■ Take  a  small  amount  of  a  sample  on  a
metal  spatula  and  heat  directly  on  the
ﬂame  (Fig.  3.7).  Repeat  with  other
samples.

■ What did you observe? Did the samples
impart any colour to the ﬂame? Do these
compounds melt?

■ Try  to  dissolve  the  samples  in  water,
petrol and kerosene. Are they soluble?

■ Make a circuit as shown in Fig. 3.8 and
insert the electrodes into a solution of one
salt. What did you observe? Test the other
salt samples too in this manner.

■ What is your inference about the nature

of these compounds?

  You  may  have  observed  the  following
general properties for ionic compounds—

(i)  Physical  nature:  Ionic  compounds  are
solids and are somewhat hard because
of the strong force of attraction between
the  positive  and  negative  ions.  These
compounds  are  generally  brittle  and
break  into  pieces  when  pressure  is
applied.

(ii)  Melting  and  Boiling  points:  Ionic
compounds  have  high  melting  and
boiling  points  (see  Table  3.4).  This  is
because  a  considerable  amount  of
energy  is  required  to  break  the  strong
inter-ionic attraction.

(iii)  Solubility:  Electrovalent  compounds
are  generally  soluble  in  water  and
insoluble in solvents such as kerosene,
petrol, etc.

(iv)  Conduction  of  Electricity:  The
conduction  of  electricity  through  a
solution  involves  the  movement  of
charged particles. A solution of an ionic
compound in water contains ions, which
move  to  the  opposite  electrodes  when
electricity  is  passed  through  the
solution. Ionic compounds in the solid
state do not conduct electricity because
movement  of  ions  in  the  solid  is  not
possible due to their rigid structure. But
ionic compounds conduct electricity in
the molten state. This is possible in the
molten state since the elecrostatic forces
of  attraction  between  the  oppositely
charged  ions  are  overcome  due  to  the
heat.  Thus,  the  ions  move  freely  and
conduct electricity.

1.   (i)  Write the electron-dot structures for

sodium, oxygen and  magnesium.
(ii)  Show  the  formation  of  Na O  and
MgO by the transfer of  electrons.
(iii) What are the ions present in these

compounds?

2.  Why  do  ionic  compounds  have  high

melting points?

3.4 OCCURRENCE OF METALS

?

  The  earth’s  crust  is  the  major  source  of
metals.  Seawater  also  contains  some  soluble
salts  such  as  sodium  chloride,  magnesium
chloride,  etc.  The  elements  or  compounds,
which occur naturally in the earth’s crust, are
known as minerals. At some places, minerals
contain a very high percentage of a particular
metal and the metal can be proﬁtably extracted
from it. These minerals are called ores.

3.4.1 Extraction of Metals

  You have learnt about the reactivity series of
metals. Having this knowledge, you can easily
understand  how  a  metal  is  extracted  from  its
ore. Some metals are found in the earth’s crust
in the free state. Some are found in the form of
their compounds. The metals at the bottom of
the activity series are the least reactive. They
are  often  found  in  a  free  state.  For  example,
gold, silver, platinum and copper are found in
the free state. Copper and silver are also found
in the combined state as their sulphide or oxide
ores. The metals at the top of the activity series
(K, Na, Ca, Mg and Al) are so reactive that they
are never found in nature as free elements.

Activity series and related metallurgy

The metals in the middle of the activity series (Zn,
Fe,  Pb,  etc.)  are  moderately  reactive.  They  are
found  in  the  earth’s  crust  mainly  as  oxides,
sulphides or carbonates. You will ﬁnd that the ores
of many metals are oxides. This is because oxygen
is a very reactive element and is very abundant on
the earth.
  Thus on the basis of reactivity, we can group the
metals into the following three categories (Fig. 3.9)
–  (i)  Metals  of  low  reactivity;  (ii)  Metals  of
medium reactivity; (iii) Metals of high reactivity.
Diﬀerent techniques are to be used for obtaining
the metals falling in each category.
  Several steps are involved in the extraction of
pure metal from ores. A summary of these steps is
given in Fig.3.10. Each step is explained in detail in
the following sections.

  Ores  mined  from  the  earth  are  usually

impurities must be removed from the ore prior
to  the  extraction  of  the  metal.  The  processes

3.4.3 Extracting Metals Low in the Activity
Series

Calcination

  Metals  low  in  the  activity  series  are  very
unreactive. The oxides of these metals can be
reduced  to  metals  by  heating  alone.  For
example, cinnabar (HgS) is an ore of mercury.
When it is heated in air, it is ﬁrst converted into
mercuric oxide (HgO). Mercuric oxide is then
reduced to mercury on further heating.

Similarly,  copper  which  is  found  as  Cu S  in
nature  can  be  obtained  from  its  ore  by  just
heating in air.

3.4.4 Extracting Metals in the Middle of the
Activity Series

  The  metals  in  the  middle  of  the  activity
series  such  as  iron,  zinc,  lead,  copper,  are
moderately reactive. These are usually present
as sulphides or carbonates in nature. It is easier
to obtain a metal from its oxide, as compared to
its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, prior to
reduction, the metal sulphides and carbonates
must  be  converted  into  metal  oxides.  The
sulphide  ores  are  converted  into  oxides  by
heating strongly in the presence of excess air.
This  process  is  known  as  roasting.  The
carbonate  ores  are  changed  into  oxides  by
heating strongly in limited air. This process is
known  as  calcination.  The  chemical  reaction
that takes place during roasting and calcination
of zinc ores can be shown as follows –
Roasting

106

  The  metal  oxides  are  then  reduced  to  the
corresponding  metals  by  using  suitable
reducing agents such as carbon. For example,
when  zinc  oxide  is  heated  with  carbon,  it  is
reduced to metallic zinc.

  ZnO(s) + C(s) ® Zn(s) + CO(g)

  You are already familiar with the process of
oxidation and reduction explained in the ﬁrst
Chapter.  Obtaining  metals  from  their
compounds is also a reduction process.
  Besides using carbon (coke) to reduce metal
oxides  to  metals,  sometimes  displacement
reactions can also be used. The highly reactive
metals  such  as  sodium,  calcium,  aluminium,
etc., are used as reducing agents because they
can  displace  metals  of  lower  reactivity  from
their  compounds.  For  example,  when
manganese dioxide is heated with aluminium
powder, the following reaction takes place –

3MnO (s) + 4Al(s) ® 3Mn(l) + 2Al O (s) + Heat

Figure 3.11 Thermit process for joining railway tracks

  Can  you  identify  the  substances  that  are  getting
oxidised and reduced?

These  displacement  reactions  are  highly
exothermic. The amount of heat evolved is so large that

  The  metal  oxides  are  then  reduced  to  the

corresponding  metals  by  using  suitable

reducing agents such as carbon. For example,

when  zinc  oxide  is  heated  with  carbon,  it  is

reduced to metallic zinc.

  ZnO(s) + C(s) ® Zn(s) + CO(g)

  You are already familiar with the process of

oxidation and reduction explained in the ﬁrst

  Besides using carbon (coke) to reduce metal

oxides  to  metals,  sometimes  displacement

reactions can also be used. The highly reactive

metals  such  as  sodium,  calcium,  aluminium,

etc., are used as reducing agents because they

can  displace  metals  of  lower  reactivity  from

their  compounds.  For  example,  when

manganese dioxide is heated with aluminium

powder, the following reaction takes place –

3MnO (s) + 4Al(s) ® 3Mn(l) + 2Al O (s) + Heat

3.4.4 Extracting Metals in the Middle of the

Activity Series

  The  metals  in  the  middle  of  the  activity

series  such  as  iron,  zinc,  lead,  copper,  are

moderately reactive. These are usually present

as sulphides or carbonates in nature. It is easier

to obtain a metal from its oxide, as compared to

its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, prior to

reduction, the metal sulphides and carbonates

must  be  converted  into  metal  oxides.  The

sulphide  ores  are  converted  into  oxides  by

heating strongly in the presence of excess air.

This  process  is  known  as  roasting.  The

carbonate  ores  are  changed  into  oxides  by

heating strongly in limited air. This process is

known  as  calcination.  The  chemical  reaction

that takes place during roasting and calcination

of zinc ores can be shown as follows –

3.4.5 Extracting Metals towards the Top of
the Activity Series

  The metals high up in the reactivity series
are very reactive. They cannot be obtained from
their compounds by heating with carbon. For
example,  carbon  cannot  reduce  the  oxides  of
sodium, magnesium, calcium, aluminium, etc.,
to the respective metals. This is because these
metals  have  more  aﬃnity  for  oxygen  than
carbon.  These  metals  are  obtained  by
electrolytic  reduction.  For  example,  sodium,
magnesium  and  calcium  are  obtained  by  the
electrolysis  of  their  molten  chlorides.  The
metals  are  deposited  at  the  cathode  (the
negatively  charged  electrode),  whereas,
chlorine is liberated at the anode (the positively
charged electrode). The reactions are –

  At anode

Na  + e ®  Na

  Similarly,  aluminium  is  obtained  by  the
electrolytic reduction of aluminium oxide.

3.4.6 Reﬁning of Metals

  The metals produced by various reduction
processes  described  above  are  not  very  pure.

of pure metal is made the cathode. A solution of
the  metal  salt  is  used  as  an  electrolyte.  The
apparatus is set up as shown in Fig. 3.12. On

pure  metal  from  the  anode  dissolves  into

3.5 CORROSION

You have learnt the following about corrosion
in Chapter 1 –
• Silver articles  become black after some time
when exposed to air. This is because it reacts
with sulphur in the air to form a coating of
silver sulphide.

• Copper reacts with moist carbon dioxide in
the  air  and  slowly  loses  its  shiny  brown
surface  and  gains  a  green  coat.  This  green
substance is basic copper carbonate.

• Iron when exposed to moist air for a long time
acquires a coating of a brown ﬂaky substance
called rust.

  Let us ﬁnd out the conditions under which
iron rusts.

Figure 3.13
Investigating the conditions under which iron rusts.
In tube A, both air and water are present. In tube B,
there is no air dissolved in the water. In tube C,
the air is dry.

■ Take three test tubes and place clean iron

nails in each of them.

■ Label these test tubes A, B and C. Pour
some water in test tube A and cork it.

■ Pour boiled distilled water in test tube B,
add about 1 mL of oil and cork it. The oil
will  ﬂoat  on  water  and  prevent  the  air
from dissolving in the water.

■ Put some anhydrous calcium chloride in
test  tube  C  and  cork  it.  Anhydrous
calcium  chloride  will  absorb  the
moisture, if any, from the air. Leave these
test tubes for a few days and then observe
(Fig. 3.13).

  You will observe that iron nails rust in test
tube A, but they do not rust in test tubes B and C.
In the test tube A, the nails are exposed to both
air and water. In the test tube B, the nails are
exposed to only water, and the nails in test tube
C are exposed to dry air. What does this tell us
about the conditions under which iron articles
rust?

3.5.1 Prevention of Corrosion

  The  rusting  of  iron  can  be  prevented  by
painting, oiling, greasing, galvanising, chrome
plating, anodising or making alloys.
  Galvanisation  is  a  method  of  protecting
steel and iron from rusting by coating them with
a  thin  layer  of  zinc. The  galvanised  article  is
protected  against  rusting  even  if  the  zinc
coating is broken. Can you reason this out?
  Alloying  is  a  very  good  method  of
improving the properties of a metal. We can get
the  desired  properties  by  this  method.  For
example, iron is the most widely used metal.
But  it  is  never  used  in  its  pure  state.  This  is
because  pure  iron  is  very  soft  and  stretches

easily when hot. But, if it is mixed with a small
amount of carbon (about 0.05 %), it becomes
hard  and  strong.  When  iron  is  mixed  with
nickel  and  chromium,  we  get  stainless  steel,
which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is
mixed with some other substance, its properties
change. In fact, the properties of any metal can
be  changed  if  it  is  mixed  with  some  other
substance. The substance added may be a metal
or  a  non-metal.  An  alloy  is  a  homogeneous
mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a
non-metal.  It  is  prepared  by  ﬁrst  melting  the
primary metal, and then, dissolving the other
elements in it in deﬁnite proportions. It is then
cooled to room temperature.

Pure gold, known as 24 carat gold, is
very soft. It is, therefore, not suitable for
making  jewellery.  It  is  alloyed  with
either silver or copper to make it hard.
Generally, in India, 22 carat gold is used
for making ornaments. It means that 22
parts of pure gold is alloyed with 2 parts
of either copper or silver.

If  one  of  the  metals  is  mercury,  then  the
alloy is known as an amalgam. The electrical
conductivity  and  melting  point  of  an  alloy  is
less  than  that  of  pure  metals.  For  example,
brass, an alloy of copper and zinc (Cu and Zn),
and bronze, an alloy of copper and tin (Cu and
Sn),  are  not  good  conductors  of  electricity
whereas  copper  is  used  for  making  electrical
circuits. Solder, an alloy of lead and tin (Pb and
Sn),  has  a  low  melting  point  and  is  used  for
welding electrical wires together.

Iron pillar at Delhi

The wonder of ancient Indian metallurgy

The iron pillar near the Qutub Minar in Delhi
was built more than 1600 years ago by the
iron workers of India.  They had developed a
process which prevented iron from rusting.
For its quality of rust resistance it has been
examined by scientists from all parts of the
world. The iron pillar is 8 m high and weighs
6 tonnes (6000 kg).

■ Elements can be classiﬁed as metals and non-metals.

■ Metals are lustrous, malleable, ductile and are good conductors of heat and electricity.

They are solids at room temperature, except mercury which is a liquid.

■ Metals can form positive ions by losing electrons to non-metals.

■ Metals combine with oxygen to form basic oxides. Aluminium oxide and zinc oxide show
the properties of both basic as well as acidic oxides. These oxides are known as amphoteric
oxides.

■ Different metals have diﬀerent reactivities with water and dilute acids.

■ A list of common metals arranged in order of their decreasing reactivity is known as an

activity series.

■ Metals above hydrogen in the Activity series can displace hydrogen from dilute acids.

■ A more reactive metal displaces a less reactive metal from its salt solution.

■ Metals occur in nature as free elements or in the form of their compounds.

■ The  extraction  of  metals  from  their  ores  and  then  reﬁning  them  for  use  is  known  as

metallurgy.

■ An  alloy  is  a  homogeneous  mixture  of  two  or  more  metals,  or  a  metal  and  a

non-metal.

■ The surface of some metals, such as iron, is corroded when they are exposed to moist air for

a long period of time. This phenomenon is known as corrosion.

■ Non-metals have properties opposite to that of metals. They are neither malleable nor
ductile.  They  are  bad  conductors  of  heat  and  electricity,  except  for  graphite,  which
conducts electricity.

■ Non-metals form negatively charged ions by gaining electrons when reacting with metals.

■ Non-metals form oxides which are either acidic or neutral.

■ Non-metals do not displace hydrogen from dilute acids. They react with hydrogen to form

hydrides.

■ Elements can be classiﬁed as metals and non-metals.

■ Metals are lustrous, malleable, ductile and are good conductors of heat and electricity.

They are solids at room temperature, except mercury which is a liquid.

■ Metals can form positive ions by losing electrons to non-metals.

■ Metals combine with oxygen to form basic oxides. Aluminium oxide and zinc oxide show

the properties of both basic as well as acidic oxides. These oxides are known as amphoteric

■ Different metals have diﬀerent reactivities with water and dilute acids.

■ A list of common metals arranged in order of their decreasing reactivity is known as an

■ Metals above hydrogen in the Activity series can displace hydrogen from dilute acids.

■ A more reactive metal displaces a less reactive metal from its salt solution.

■ The surface of some metals, such as iron, is corroded when they are exposed to moist air for

a long period of time. This phenomenon is known as corrosion.

■ Non-metals have properties opposite to that of metals. They are neither malleable nor

ductile.  They  are  bad  conductors  of  heat  and  electricity,  except  for  graphite,  which

conducts electricity.

■ Non-metals form negatively charged ions by gaining electrons when reacting with metals.

■ Non-metals form oxides which are either acidic or neutral.

■ Non-metals do not displace hydrogen from dilute acids. They react with hydrogen to form

hydrides.

(c) Aluminium is a highly
reactive metal, yet it is used to
make utensils for cooking.

(d) Carbonate and sulphide
ores are usually converted into oxides
during the process of extraction.

vessels  being  cleaned  with  lemon  or
tamarind  juice.  Explain  why  these  sour
substances are effective in cleaning the vessels.

14.  Differentiate between metal and non-metal on the basis of their chemical properties.
15.  A man went door to door posing as a goldsmith. He promised to bring back the
glitter of old and dull gold ornaments. An unsuspecting lady gave a set of gold
bangles to him which he dipped in a particular solution. The bangles sparkled like
new but their weight was reduced drastically. The lady was upset but after a futile
argument the man beat a hasty retreat. Can you play the detective to ﬁnd out the
nature of the solution he had used?

iron).

n the last Chapter, we came to know many

Icompounds  of  importance  to  us.  In  this

Chapter  we  will  study  about  some  more
interesting compounds and their properties.
Also, we shall be learning about carbon, an
element which is of immense signiﬁcance to
us  in  both  its  elemental  form  and  in  the
combined form.

• Make a list of ten things you have
used  or  consumed  since  the
morning.

•

•

Compile this list with the lists made
by your classmates and then sort the
items into the adjacent Table.

If there are items which are made up
of more than one material, put them
into  both  the  relevant  columns  of
the table.

Look  at  the  items  that  come  in  the  last
column of the above table ﬁlled by you – your
teacher will be able to tell you that most of them
are made up of compounds of carbon. Can you
think of a method to test this? What would be
the product if a compound containing carbon is
burnt? Do you know of any test to conﬁrm this?
Food, clothes, medicines, books, or many
of the things that you listed are all based on this
versatile element carbon. In addition, all living
structures  are  carbon  based.  The  amount  of
carbon  present  in  the  earth’s  crust  and  in  the
atmosphere is quite meagre. The earth’s crust
has only 0.02% carbon in the form of minerals
(like  carbonates,  hydrogen-  carbonates,  coal
and petroleum) and the atmosphere has 0.03%
of carbon dioxide. In spite of this small amount
of carbon available in nature, the importance of
carbon seems to be immense. In this Chapter,
we  will  know  about  the  properties  of  carbon
which make carbon so important to us.

saw  how  the  nature  of  bonding  in  ionic
compounds  explains  these  properties.  Let  us
now  study  the  properties  of  some  carbon
compounds.
  Most  carbon  compounds  are  poor
conductors  of  electricity  as  we  have  seen  in
Chapter 2. From the data  given in Table 4.1 on
the  boiling  and  melting  points  of  the  carbon
compounds,  we  ﬁnd  that  these  compounds
have  low  melting  and  boiling  points  as
compared to ionic compounds (Chapter 3). We
can  conclude  that  the  forces  of  attraction
between  the  molecules  are  not  very  strong.
Since  these  compounds  are  largely  non-
conductors of electricity, we can conclude that
the bonding in these compounds does not give
rise to any ions.

In  Class  IX,  we  learnt  about  the
combining  capacity  of  various  elements  and
how  it  depends  on  the  number  of  valence
electrons.  Let  us  now  look  at  the  electronic
conﬁguration of carbon. The atomic number of
carbon is 6. What would be the distribution of
electrons  in  various  shells  of  carbon?  How
many valence electrons will carbon have?

We know that the reactivity of elements
is  explained  as  their  tendency  to  attain  a
completely  ﬁlled  outer  shell,  that  is,  attain
noble  gas  conﬁguration.  Elements  forming
ionic compounds achieve this by either gaining
or losing electrons from the outermost shell. In
the case of carbon, it has four electrons in its
outermost shell and needs to gain or lose four
electrons to attain noble gas conﬁguration. If it
were to gain or lose electrons –

(i) It could gain four electrons forming
4–C anion.  But  it  would  be  difficult  for  the
nucleus  with  six  protons  to  hold  on  to  ten
electrons, that is, four extra electrons.

(ii) It could lose four electrons forming
4+C cation. But it would require a large amount
of  energy  to  remove  four  electrons  leaving
behind a carbon cation with six protons in its
nucleus holding on to just two electrons.

Carbon  overcomes  this  problem  by
sharing its valence electrons with other atoms
of carbon or with atoms of other elements. Not
just  carbon,  but  many  other  elements  form
molecules by sharing electrons in this manner.
The shared electrons ‘belong’ to the outermost
shells of both the atoms and lead to both atoms
attaining  the  noble  gas  conﬁguration.  Before
going on to compounds of carbon, let us look at
some simple molecules formed by the sharing
of valence electrons.

The  simplest  molecule  formed  in  this
manner is that of hydrogen. As you have learnt
earlier,  the  atomic  number  of  hydrogen  is  1.
Hence hydrogen has one electron in its K shell
and it requires one more electron to ﬁll the K
shell.  So  two  hydrogen  atoms  share  their
electrons to form a molecule of hydrogen, H . 2
This allows each hydrogen atom to attain the

Figure 4.1      A molecule of hydrogen

electronic  conﬁguration  of  the  nearest  noble
gas, helium, which has two electrons in its K
shell. We can depict this using dots or crosses to
represent valence electrons (Fig. 4.1).

The  shared  pair  of  electrons  is  said  to
constitute a single covalent bond between the
two hydrogen atoms. A single covalent bond is
also  represented  by  a  line  between  the  two
atoms, as shown in Fig. 4.2.

Figure 4.2    Single bond between two hydrogen atoms

The  atomic  number  of  chlorine  is  17.
What would be its electronic conﬁguration and
its  valency?  Chlorine  forms  a  diatomic
molecule, Cl . Can you draw the electron dot
structure for this molecule? Note that only the
valence shell electrons need to be depicted.

In  the  case  of  oxygen,  we  see  the
formation  of  a  double  bond  between  two
oxygen  atoms.  This  is  because  an  atom  of
oxygen  has  six  electrons  in  its  L  shell  (the
atomic  number  of  oxygen  is  eight)  and  it
requires  two  more  electrons  to  complete  its
octet.  So  each  atom  of  oxygen  shares  two
electrons with another atom of oxygen to give
us  the  structure  shown  in  Fig.  4.3.  The  two
electrons  contributed  by  each  oxygen  atom
give rise to two shared pairs of electrons. This is
said  to  constitute  a  double  bond  between  the
two atoms.

Can you now depict a molecule of water
showing  the  nature  of  bonding  between  one
oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms? Does
the  molecule  have  single  bonds  or  double
bonds?
     What would happen in the case of a diatomic
molecule of nitrogen? Nitrogen has the atomic
number  7.  What  would  be  its  electronic
conﬁguration  and  its  combining  capacity?  In
order to attain an octet, each nitrogen atom in a
molecule  of  nitrogen  contributes  three
electrons  giving  rise  to  three  shared  pairs  of
electrons. This is said to constitute a triple bond
between  the  two  atoms.  The  electron  dot
structure  of  N   and  its  triple  bond  can  be
depicted as in Fig. 4.4.

      Let us now take a look at methane, which is
a compound of carbon. Methane is widely used
as a fuel and is a major component of bio-gas
and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). It is also
one  of  the  simplest  compounds  formed  by
carbon. Methane has a formula CH . Hydrogen,
as  you  know,  has  a  valency  of  1.  Carbon  is
tetravalent  because  it  has  four  valence
electrons.  In  order  to  achieve  noble  gas
conﬁguration,  carbon  shares  these  electrons
with four atoms of hydrogen as shown in Fig.

each carbon atom is bonded to three other
carbon  atoms  in  the  same  plane  giving  a
hexagonal  array.  One  of  these  bonds  is  a
double-bond,  and  thus  the  valency  of
carbon  is  satisﬁed.  Graphite  structure  is
formed  by  the  hexagonal  arrays  being
placed in layers one above the other.

of  an  electron  pair  between  two  atoms  are
known as covalent bonds. Covalently bonded
molecules are seen to have strong bonds within
the  molecule,  but  inter-molecular  forces  are
weak. This  gives  rise  to  the  low  melting  and

Diamonds can be synthesised by subjecting
pure  carbon  to  very  high  pressure  and
temperature. These synthetic diamonds are
small  but  are  otherwise  indistinguishable
from natural diamonds.
Fullerenes  form  another  class  of  carbon
allotropes. The ﬁrst one to be identiﬁed was
C-60 which has carbon atoms arranged in
the  shape  of  a  football.  Since  this  looked
like the geodesic dome designed by the US
architect Buckminster Fuller, the molecule
was named fullerene.

of carbon dioxide which has the formula
CO ?2

2. What would be the electron dot structure

up of eight atoms of sulphur? (Hint – The
eight  atoms  of  sulphur  are  joined

4.2 VERSATILE NATURE OF CARBON

  We  have  seen  the  formation  of  covalent
bonds  by  the  sharing  of  electrons  in  various
elements  and  compounds. We  have  also  seen
the  structure  of  a  simple  carbon  compound,
methane. In the beginning of the Chapter, we
saw how many things we use contain carbon. In
fact,  we  ourselves  are  made  up  of  carbon
c o m p o u n d s .   T h e   n u m b e r s   o f   c a r b o n
compounds  whose  formulae  are  known  to
chemists  was  recently  estimated  to  be  in
millions! This  outnumbers  by  a  large  margin
the  compounds  formed  by  all  the  other
elements  put  together.  Why  is  it  that  this
property  is  seen  in  carbon  and  no  other
element?  The  nature  of  the  covalent  bond

130

enables  carbon  to  form  a  large  number  of
compounds. Two factors noticed in the case of
carbon are –

(i)  Carbon  has  the  unique  ability  to  form
bonds with other atoms of carbon, giving rise to
large  molecules.  This  property  is  called
catenation. These  compounds  may  have  long
chains of carbon, branched chains of carbon or
even  carbon  atoms  arranged  in  rings.  In
addition, carbon atoms may be linked by single,
double or triple bonds. Compounds of carbon,
which are linked by only single bonds between
the  carbon  atoms  are  called  saturated
compounds.  Compounds  of  carbon  having
double  or  triple  bonds  between  their  carbon
atoms are called unsaturated compounds.

  No other element exhibits the property of
catenation  to  the  extent  seen  in  carbon
compounds.  Silicon  forms  compounds  with
hydrogen which have chains of upto seven or
eight  atoms,  but  these  compounds  are  very
reactive.  The  carbon-carbon  bond  is  very
strong and hence stable. This gives us the large
number of compounds with many carbon atoms
linked to each other.

(ii) Since carbon has a valency of four, it is
capable  of  bonding  with  four  other  atoms  of
carbon  or  atoms  of  some  other  mono-valent
element.  Compounds  of  carbon  are  formed
with  oxygen,  hydrogen,  nitrogen,  sulphur,
chlorine and many other elements giving rise to
compounds  with  speciﬁc  properties  which
depend  on  the  elements  other  than  carbon
present in the molecule.

  Again  the  bonds  that  carbon  forms  with
most  other  elements  are  very  strong  making
these  compounds  exceptionally  stable.  One
reason  for  the  formation  of  strong  bonds  by
carbon  is  its  small  size.  This  enables  the
nucleus  to  hold  on  to  the  shared  pairs  of
electrons  strongly.  The  bonds  formed  by
elements  having  bigger  atoms  are  much
weaker.

also  a  very  good  conductor  of  electricity

unlike other non-metals that you studied in

the previous Chapter.

Diamonds can be synthesised by subjecting

pure  carbon  to  very  high  pressure  and

temperature. These synthetic diamonds are

small  but  are  otherwise  indistinguishable

from natural diamonds.

Fullerenes  form  another  class  of  carbon

allotropes. The ﬁrst one to be identiﬁed was

C-60 which has carbon atoms arranged in

the  shape  of  a  football.  Since  this  looked

like the geodesic dome designed by the US

architect Buckminster Fuller, the molecule

was named fullerene.

1. What would be the electron dot structure

of carbon dioxide which has the formula

CO ?2

2. What would be the electron dot structure

of a molecule of sulphur which is made

up of eight atoms of sulphur? (Hint – The

eight  atoms  of  sulphur  are  joined

together in the form of a ring.)

?

4.2 VERSATILE NATURE OF CARBON

  We  have  seen  the  formation  of  covalent

bonds  by  the  sharing  of  electrons  in  various

elements  and  compounds. We  have  also  seen

the  structure  of  a  simple  carbon  compound,

methane. In the beginning of the Chapter, we

saw how many things we use contain carbon. In

fact,  we  ourselves  are  made  up  of  carbon

c o m p o u n d s .   T h e   n u m b e r s   o f   c a r b o n

compounds  whose  formulae  are  known  to

chemists  was  recently  estimated  to  be  in

millions! This  outnumbers  by  a  large  margin

the  compounds  formed  by  all  the  other

elements  put  together.  Why  is  it  that  this

property  is  seen  in  carbon  and  no  other

element?  The  nature  of  the  covalent  bond

130

enables  carbon  to  form  a  large  number  of

compounds. Two factors noticed in the case of

carbon are –

(i)  Carbon  has  the  unique  ability  to  form

bonds with other atoms of carbon, giving rise to

large  molecules.  This  property  is  called

catenation. These  compounds  may  have  long

chains of carbon, branched chains of carbon or

even  carbon  atoms  arranged  in  rings.  In

addition, carbon atoms may be linked by single,

double or triple bonds. Compounds of carbon,

which are linked by only single bonds between

the  carbon  atoms  are  called  saturated

compounds.  Compounds  of  carbon  having

double  or  triple  bonds  between  their  carbon

atoms are called unsaturated compounds.

  No other element exhibits the property of

catenation  to  the  extent  seen  in  carbon

compounds.  Silicon  forms  compounds  with

hydrogen which have chains of upto seven or

eight  atoms,  but  these  compounds  are  very

reactive.  The  carbon-carbon  bond  is  very

strong and hence stable. This gives us the large

number of compounds with many carbon atoms

linked to each other.

(ii) Since carbon has a valency of four, it is

capable  of  bonding  with  four  other  atoms  of

carbon  or  atoms  of  some  other  mono-valent

element.  Compounds  of  carbon  are  formed

with  oxygen,  hydrogen,  nitrogen,  sulphur,

chlorine and many other elements giving rise to

compounds  with  speciﬁc  properties  which

depend  on  the  elements  other  than  carbon

present in the molecule.

  Again  the  bonds  that  carbon  forms  with

most  other  elements  are  very  strong  making

these  compounds  exceptionally  stable.  One

reason  for  the  formation  of  strong  bonds  by

carbon  is  its  small  size.  This  enables  the

nucleus  to  hold  on  to  the  shared  pairs  of

electrons  strongly.  The  bonds  formed  by

elements  having  bigger  atoms  are  much

weaker.

Organic compounds
The  two  characteristic  features  seen  in
carbon, that is, tetravalency and catenation,
put together give rise to a large number of
compounds.  Many  have  the  same  non-
carbon atom or group of atoms attached to
different carbon chains. These compounds
were  initially  extracted  from  natural
substances  and  it  was  thought  that  these
carbon compounds or organic compounds
could  only  be  formed  within  a  living
system.  That  is,  it  was  postulated  that  a
‘vital  force’  was  necessary  for  their
synthesis. Friedrich Wöhler disproved this
in 1828 by preparing urea from ammonium
cyanate. But carbon compounds, except for
carbides, oxides of carbon, carbonate and
hydrogencarbonate  salts  continue  to  be
studied under organic chemistry.

Compounds

  We  have  already  seen  the  structure  of
methane. Another compound formed between
carbon and hydrogen is ethane with a formula
of  C H .  In  order  to  arrive  at  the  structure  of
simple carbon  compounds,  the  ﬁrst  step  is  to
link  the  carbon  atoms  together  with  a  single
bond  (Fig.  4.6a)  and  then  use  the  hydrogen
atoms  to  satisfy  the  remaining  valencies  of
carbon (Fig. 4.6b). For example, the structure
of ethane is arrived in the following steps –

                    C—C
Figure 4.6 (a)
Carbon atoms linked together with a single bond

          Step 1

Three  valencies  of  each  carbon  atom  remain
unsatisﬁed, so each is bonded to three hydrogen
atoms giving:

        Step 2

Figure 4.6 (b)
Each carbon atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms

Figure 4.6 (c)
Electron dot structure of ethane

The electron dot structure of ethane is shown in
Fig. 4.6(c).

Can  you  draw  the  structure  of  propane,
which  has  the  molecular  formula  C H in  a
similar manner? You will see that the valencies
of  all  the  atoms  are  satisﬁed  by  single  bonds
between  them.  Such  carbon  compounds  are
called saturated compounds. These compounds
are normally not very reactive.

However, another compound of carbon and
hydrogen  has  the  formula  C H   and  is  called
ethene. How can this molecule be depicted? We
follow the same step-wise approach as above.

Carbon-carbon atoms linked together with a

single bond (Step 1).

We  see  that  one  valency  per  carbon  atom
remains  unsatisﬁed  (Step  2).  This  can  be
satisﬁed only if there is a double bond between
the two carbons (Step 3).

  But, let us take another look at butane. If we
make  the  carbon  ‘skeleton’  with  four  carbon
atoms,  we  see  that  two  different  possible
‘skeletons’ are –

C—C—C—C

Figure 4.8 (a) Two possible carbon-skeletons

Filling the remaining valencies with hydrogen
gives us –

Figure 4.8 (b) Complete molecules for two structures
with formula C H4

10

  We see that both these structures have the
same  formula  C H .  Such  compounds  with
identical  molecular  formula  but  different
structures are called structural isomers.

10

In addition to straight and branched carbon
chains,  some  compounds  have  carbon  atoms
arranged  in  the  form  of  a  ring.  For  example,
cyclohexane  has  the  formula  C H   and  the
following structure

 (b)

Figure 4.9 Structure of cyclohexane (a) carbon skeleton
(b) complete molecule

  Can you draw the electron dot structure for
cyclohexane?  Straight  chain,  branched  chain
and  cyclic  carbon  compounds,  all  may  be
saturated  or  unsaturated.  For  example,
benzene, C H , has the following structure –

Benzene — C H6

uÉ+JHŽ — C H6

Figure 4.10 Structure of benzene

  All these carbon compounds which contain
only  carbon  and  hydrogen  are  called
hydrocarbons.  Among  these,  the  saturated
hydrocarbons  are  called  alkanes.  The
unsaturated hydrocarbons which contain one or
more double bonds are called alkenes. Those
containing one or more triple bonds are called
alkynes.

4.2.3 Will you be my Friend?

     Carbon seems to be a very friendly element.
So  far  we  have  been  looking  at  compounds
containing  carbon  and  hydrogen  only.  But
carbon also forms bonds with other elements
such  as  halogens,  oxygen,  nitrogen  and
sulphur. In a hydrocarbon chain, one or more
hydrogens can be replaced by these elements,
such  that  the  valency  of  carbon  remains
satisﬁed.  In  such  compounds,  the  element
replacing  hydrogen  is  referred  to  as  a
heteroatom. These heteroatoms are also present
in  some  groups  as  given  in  Table  4.3.  These
heteroatoms  and  the  group  containing  these
confer  speciﬁc  properties  to  the  compound,
regardless of the length and nature of the carbon
chain and hence are called functional groups.
Some important functional groups are given in
the Table 4.3. Free valency or valencies of the
group  are  shown  by  the  single  line.  The
functional group is attached to the carbon chain
through this valency by replacing one hydrogen
atom or atoms.

  But, let us take another look at butane. If we

make  the  carbon  ‘skeleton’  with  four  carbon

atoms,  we  see  that  two  different  possible

Benzene — C H6

‘skeletons’ are –

C—C—C—C

gives us –

  All these carbon compounds which contain

  We see that both these structures have the

same  formula  C H .  Such  compounds  with

4

10

identical  molecular  formula  but  different

structures are called structural isomers.

In addition to straight and branched carbon

chains,  some  compounds  have  carbon  atoms

arranged  in  the  form  of  a  ring.  For  example,

cyclohexane  has  the  formula  C H   and  the

  Can you draw the electron dot structure for

and  cyclic  carbon  compounds,  all  may  be

only  carbon  and  hydrogen  are  called

hydrocarbons.  Among  these,  the  saturated

hydrocarbons  are  called  alkanes.  The

unsaturated hydrocarbons which contain one or

more double bonds are called alkenes. Those

containing one or more triple bonds are called

4.2.3 Will you be my Friend?

     Carbon seems to be a very friendly element.

So  far  we  have  been  looking  at  compounds

containing  carbon  and  hydrogen  only.  But

carbon also forms bonds with other elements

such  as  halogens,  oxygen,  nitrogen  and

sulphur. In a hydrocarbon chain, one or more

hydrogens can be replaced by these elements,

such  that  the  valency  of  carbon  remains

satisﬁed.  In  such  compounds,  the  element

replacing  hydrogen  is  referred  to  as  a

heteroatom. These heteroatoms are also present

in  some  groups  as  given  in  Table  4.3.  These

heteroatoms  and  the  group  containing  these

confer  speciﬁc  properties  to  the  compound,

regardless of the length and nature of the carbon

chain and hence are called functional groups.

Some important functional groups are given in

the Table 4.3. Free valency or valencies of the

group  are  shown  by  the  single  line.  The

functional group is attached to the carbon chain

through this valency by replacing one hydrogen

atom or atoms.

4.2.4 Homologous Series
You have seen that carbon atoms can be linked
together  to  form  chains  of  varying  lengths.
These chains can be branched also. In addition,
hydrogen atom or other atoms on these carbon
chains can be replaced by any of the functional
groups that we saw above. The presence of a
functional  group  such  as  alcohol  decides  the
properties of the carbon compound, regardless
of the length of the carbon chain. For example,
the  chemical  properties  of  CH OH,  C H OH,
C H OH  and  C H OH  are  all  very  similar.
Hence, such a series of compounds in which the
same functional group substitutes for hydrogen
in a carbon chain is called a homologous series.
  Let us look at the homologous series that we
saw  earlier  in  Table  4.2.  If  we  look  at  the
formulae of successive compounds, say –
CH  and C H   —
C H  and C H   —
What is the difference between the next pair –
propane and butane (C H )?

masses between these pairs (the atomic mass of
carbon is 12 u and the atomic mass of hydrogen
is 1 u)?
  Similarly,  take  the  homologous  series  for
alkenes. The ﬁrst member of the series is ethene
which  we  have  already  come  across  in
Section 4.2.1. What is the formula for ethene?
The  succeeding  members  have  the  formula
C H , C H  and C H . Do these also differ by a
–CH – unit?
  Do you see any relation between the number
of  carbon  and  hydrogen  atoms  in  these
compounds? The general formula for alkenes
can be written as C H , where n = 2, 3, 4. Can
2n
you similarly generate the general formula for
alkanes and alkynes?
  As  the  molecular  mass  increases  in  any
homologous  series,  a  gradation  in  physical
properties is seen. This is because the melting
and  boiling  points  increase  with  increasing
molecular mass. Other physical properties such
as solubility in a particular solvent also show a
similar gradation. But the chemical properties,

Can we call this family a homologous

Generate  the  homologous  series  for
compounds  containing  up  to  four
carbons for the other functional groups
given in Table 4.3.

4.2.5 Nomenclature of Carbon Compounds
       The names of compounds in a homologous
series are based on the name of the basic carbon
chain modiﬁed by a “preﬁx” “phrase before” or
“suffix” “phrase after” indicating the nature of
the functional group. For example, the names

of  the  alcohols  taken  in  Activity  4.2  are
methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol.
Naming a carbon compound can be done by the
following method –

(i) Identify the number of carbon atoms in
the  compound.  A  compound  having  three
carbon atoms would have the name propane.

(ii) In case a functional group is present, it is
indicated  in  the  name  of  the  compound  with
either a preﬁx or a suffix (as given in Table 4.4).
(iii) If the name of the functional group is to
be  given  as  a  suffix,  and  the  suffix  of  the
functional group begins with a vowel a, e, i, o,
u, then the name of the carbon chain is modiﬁed
by  deleting  the  ﬁnal  ‘e’  and  adding  the
appropriate suffix. For example, a three-carbon
chain with a ketone group would be named in
the following manner –
  Propane – ‘e’ = propan + ‘one’ = propanone.

(iv) If the carbon chain is unsaturated, then
the ﬁnal ‘ane’ in the name of the carbon chain is
substituted by ‘ene’ or ‘yne’ as given in Table
4.4. For example, a three-carbon chain with a
double bond would be called propene and if it
has a triple bond, it would be called propyne.

4.3.1 Combustion
  Carbon, in all its allotropic forms, burns in
oxygen to give carbon dioxide along with the
release  of  heat  and  light.  Most  carbon
compounds also release a large amount of heat
and light on burning. These are the oxidation
reactions  that  you  learnt  about  in  the  ﬁrst
Chapter –

  (iii)  CH CH OH + O  ® CO  + H O + heat

         and light
  Balance  the  latter  two  reactions  like  you
learnt in the ﬁrst Chapter.

CAUTION:  This  Activity  needs  the
teacher’s assistance.

Ta k e   s o m e   c a r b o n   c o m p o u n d s
(naphthalene, camphor, alcohol) one by
one on a spatula and burn them.

Observe the nature of the ﬂame and note
whether smoke is produced.

Place a metal plate above the ﬂame. Is
there a deposition on the plate in case of
any of the compounds?

Light a bunsen burner and adjust the air
hole at the base to get different types of
ﬂames/presence of smoke.

When do you get a yellow, sooty ﬂame?

When do you get a blue ﬂame?

  Saturated hydrocarbons will generally give
a  clean  ﬂame  while  unsaturated  carbon
compounds will give a yellow ﬂame with lots of
black smoke. This results in a sooty deposit on

144

the  metal  plate  in  Activity  4.3.  However,
limiting the supply of air results in incomplete
combustion  of  even  saturated  hydrocarbons
giving a sooty ﬂame. The gas/kerosene stove
used  at  home  has  inlets  for  air  so  that  a
sufficiently  oxygen-rich  mixture  is  burnt  to
give  a  clean  blue  ﬂame.  If  you  observe  the
bottoms of cooking vessels getting blackened,
it means that the air holes are blocked and fuel
is  getting  wasted.  Fuels  such  as  coal  and
petroleum have some amount of nitrogen and
sulphur in them. Their combustion results in the
formation  of  oxides  of  sulphur  and  nitrogen
which are major pollutants in the environment.

Why do substances burn with or
without a ﬂame ?
  Have you ever observed either a coal or a
wood ﬁre? If not, the next time you get a
chance,  take  close  note  of  what  happens
when the wood or coal starts to burn. You
have seen above that a candle or the LPG in
the gas stove burns with a ﬂame. However,
you will observe the coal or charcoal in an
‘angithi’  sometimes  just  glows  red  and
gives  out  heat  without  a  ﬂame.  This  is
because  a  ﬂame  is  only  produced  when
gaseous  substances  burn.  When  wood  or
charcoal is ignited, the volatile substances
present vapourise and burn with a ﬂame in
the beginning.
  A luminous ﬂame is seen when the atoms
of the gaseous substance are heated and start
to  glow.  The  colour  produced  by  each
element is a characteristic property of that
element. Try and heat a copper wire in the
ﬂame of a gas stove and observe its  colour.
You have seen that incomplete combustion
gives soot which is carbon. On this basis,
what will you attribute the yellow colour of
a candle ﬂame to?

  Balance  the  latter  two  reactions  like  you

learnt in the ﬁrst Chapter.

the  metal  plate  in  Activity  4.3.  However,

limiting the supply of air results in incomplete

combustion  of  even  saturated  hydrocarbons

giving a sooty ﬂame. The gas/kerosene stove

used  at  home  has  inlets  for  air  so  that  a

sufficiently  oxygen-rich  mixture  is  burnt  to

give  a  clean  blue  ﬂame.  If  you  observe  the

bottoms of cooking vessels getting blackened,

it means that the air holes are blocked and fuel

is  getting  wasted.  Fuels  such  as  coal  and

petroleum have some amount of nitrogen and

sulphur in them. Their combustion results in the

formation  of  oxides  of  sulphur  and  nitrogen

which are major pollutants in the environment.

CAUTION:  This  Activity  needs  the

teacher’s assistance.

Ta k e   s o m e   c a r b o n   c o m p o u n d s

(naphthalene, camphor, alcohol) one by

one on a spatula and burn them.

Observe the nature of the ﬂame and note

whether smoke is produced.

Place a metal plate above the ﬂame. Is

there a deposition on the plate in case of

any of the compounds?

Light a bunsen burner and adjust the air

hole at the base to get different types of

ﬂames/presence of smoke.

When do you get a yellow, sooty ﬂame?

When do you get a blue ﬂame?

  Saturated hydrocarbons will generally give

a  clean  ﬂame  while  unsaturated  carbon

compounds will give a yellow ﬂame with lots of

black smoke. This results in a sooty deposit on

144

Why do substances burn with or

without a ﬂame ?

  Have you ever observed either a coal or a

wood ﬁre? If not, the next time you get a

chance,  take  close  note  of  what  happens

when the wood or coal starts to burn. You

have seen above that a candle or the LPG in

the gas stove burns with a ﬂame. However,

you will observe the coal or charcoal in an

‘angithi’  sometimes  just  glows  red  and

gives  out  heat  without  a  ﬂame.  This  is

because  a  ﬂame  is  only  produced  when

gaseous  substances  burn.  When  wood  or

charcoal is ignited, the volatile substances

present vapourise and burn with a ﬂame in

the beginning.

  A luminous ﬂame is seen when the atoms

of the gaseous substance are heated and start

to  glow.  The  colour  produced  by  each

element is a characteristic property of that

element. Try and heat a copper wire in the

ﬂame of a gas stove and observe its  colour.

You have seen that incomplete combustion

gives soot which is carbon. On this basis,

what will you attribute the yellow colour of

a candle ﬂame to?

Some  other  metals  also  get  tarnished  in  this

manner.  Have  you  noticed  the  colour  of  the

coating formed on copper and silver? When a

metal is attacked by substances around it such

as moisture, acids, etc., it is said to corrode and

this  process  is  called  corrosion.  The  black

coating  on  silver  and  the  green  coating  on

copper are other examples of corrosion.

Corrosion  causes  damage  to  car  bodies,

Formation of coal and petroleum
Coal and petroleum have been formed from
biomass  which  has  been  subjected  to
v a r i o u s   b i o l o g i c a l   a n d   g e o l o g i c a l
processes.  Coal  is  the  remains  of  trees,
ferns, and other plants that lived millions of
years  ago.  These  were  crushed  into  the
earth,  perhaps  by  earthquakes  or  volcanic
eruptions.  They  were  pressed  down  by
layers  of  earth  and  rock.  They  slowly
decayed  into  coal.  Oil  and  gas  are  the
remains  of  millions  of  tiny  plants  and
animals  that  lived  in  the  sea.  When  they
died, their bodies sank to the sea bed and
were covered by silt. Bacteria attacked the
dead remains, turning them into oil and gas
under  the  high  pressures  they  were  being
subjected to. Meanwhile, the silt was slowly
compressed  into  rock.  The  oil  and  gas
seeped into the porous parts of the rock, and
got trapped like water in a sponge. Can you
guess  why  coal  and  petroleum  are  called
fossil fuels?

4.3.2 Oxidation

Take about 3 mL of ethanol in a test tube
and warm it gently in a water bath.

Add a 5% solution of alkaline potassium
permanganate  drop  by  drop  to  this
solution.

D o e s   t h e   c o l o u r   o f   p o t a s s i u m
permanganate persist  when  it  is  added
initially?

Why  does  the  colour  of  potassium
permanganate  not  disappear  when
excess is added?

  You have learnt about oxidation reactions in
the  ﬁrst  Chapter.  Carbon  compounds  can  be
easily oxidised on combustion. In addition to
this complete oxidation, we have reactions in
which  alcohols  are  converted  to  carboxylic
acids –

  We see that some substances are capable of
adding oxygen to others. These substances are
known as oxidising agents.
  Alkaline  potassium  permanganate  or
acidiﬁed  potassium  dichromate  are  oxidising
alcohols to acids, that is, adding oxygen to the
starting  material.  Hence  they  are  known  as
oxidising agents.

4.3.3 Addition Reaction

  Unsaturated hydrocarbons add hydrogen in
the presence of catalysts such as palladium or
nickel  to  give  saturated  hydrocarbons.
Catalysts are substances that cause a reaction to
occur or proceed at a diﬀerent rate without the
reaction itself being aﬀected. This reaction is
commonly  used  in  the  hydrogenation  of
vegetable oils using a nickel catalyst. Vegetable
oils  generally  have  long  unsaturated  carbon
chains while animal fats have saturated carbon
chains.

  You must have seen advertisements stating
that some vegetable oils are ‘healthy’. Animal
fats  generally  contain  saturated  fatty  acids
which  are  said  to  be  harmful  for  health.  Oils
containing  unsaturated  fatty  acids  should  be
chosen for cooking.

manner.  Have  you  noticed  the  colour  of  the

coating formed on copper and silver? When a

metal is attacked by substances around it such

as moisture, acids, etc., it is said to corrode and

this  process  is  called  corrosion.  The  black

coating  on  silver  and  the  green  coating  on

copper are other examples of corrosion.

Corrosion  causes  damage  to  car  bodies,

Formation of coal and petroleum

Coal and petroleum have been formed from

biomass  which  has  been  subjected  to

v a r i o u s   b i o l o g i c a l   a n d   g e o l o g i c a l

processes.  Coal  is  the  remains  of  trees,

ferns, and other plants that lived millions of

years  ago.  These  were  crushed  into  the

earth,  perhaps  by  earthquakes  or  volcanic

eruptions.  They  were  pressed  down  by

layers  of  earth  and  rock.  They  slowly

decayed  into  coal.  Oil  and  gas  are  the

  You have learnt about oxidation reactions in

the  ﬁrst  Chapter.  Carbon  compounds  can  be

easily oxidised on combustion. In addition to

this complete oxidation, we have reactions in

which  alcohols  are  converted  to  carboxylic

acids –

  We see that some substances are capable of

adding oxygen to others. These substances are

known as oxidising agents.

remains  of  millions  of  tiny  plants  and

  Alkaline  potassium  permanganate  or

animals  that  lived  in  the  sea.  When  they

acidiﬁed  potassium  dichromate  are  oxidising

died, their bodies sank to the sea bed and

alcohols to acids, that is, adding oxygen to the

were covered by silt. Bacteria attacked the

starting  material.  Hence  they  are  known  as

dead remains, turning them into oil and gas

oxidising agents.

under  the  high  pressures  they  were  being

subjected to. Meanwhile, the silt was slowly

compressed  into  rock.  The  oil  and  gas

seeped into the porous parts of the rock, and

got trapped like water in a sponge. Can you

guess  why  coal  and  petroleum  are  called

fossil fuels?

4.3.2 Oxidation

Take about 3 mL of ethanol in a test tube

and warm it gently in a water bath.

Add a 5% solution of alkaline potassium

permanganate  drop  by  drop  to  this

solution.

D o e s   t h e   c o l o u r   o f   p o t a s s i u m

permanganate persist  when  it  is  added

Why  does  the  colour  of  potassium

permanganate  not  disappear  when

excess is added?

4.3.3 Addition Reaction

  Unsaturated hydrocarbons add hydrogen in

the presence of catalysts such as palladium or

nickel  to  give  saturated  hydrocarbons.

Catalysts are substances that cause a reaction to

occur or proceed at a diﬀerent rate without the

reaction itself being aﬀected. This reaction is

commonly  used  in  the  hydrogenation  of

vegetable oils using a nickel catalyst. Vegetable

oils  generally  have  long  unsaturated  carbon

chains while animal fats have saturated carbon

chains.

  You must have seen advertisements stating

that some vegetable oils are ‘healthy’. Animal

fats  generally  contain  saturated  fatty  acids

which  are  said  to  be  harmful  for  health.  Oils

containing  unsaturated  fatty  acids  should  be

chosen for cooking.

reagents. However, in the presence of sunlight,
chlorine is added to hydrocarbons in a very fast
reaction.  Chlorine  can  replace  the  hydrogen
atoms  one  by  one.  It  is  called  a  substitution
reaction because one type of atom or a group of
atoms takes the place of another. A number of
products  are  usually  formed  with  the  higher
homologues of alkanes.

good solvent, it is also used in medicines such
as  tincture  iodine,  cough  syrups,  and  many
tonics.  Ethanol  is  also  soluble  in  water  in  all
proportions. Consumption of small quantities
of  dilute  ethanol  causes  drunkenness.  Even
though  this  practice  is  condemned,  it  is  a
socially widespread practice. However, intake
of even a small quantity of pure ethanol (called
absolute alcohol) can be lethal. Also, long-term
consumption of alcohol leads to many health
problems.

and ethanoic acid.

4.4.1 Properties of Ethanol
  Ethanol  is  a  liquid  at  room  temperature
(refer to Table 4.1 for the melting and boiling
points of ethanol). Ethanol is commonly called
alcohol  and  is  the  active  ingredient  of  all
alcoholic  drinks.  In  addition,  because  it  is  a

chlorine is added to hydrocarbons in a very fast

reaction.  Chlorine  can  replace  the  hydrogen

atoms  one  by  one.  It  is  called  a  substitution

reaction because one type of atom or a group of

atoms takes the place of another. A number of

products  are  usually  formed  with  the  higher

homologues of alkanes.

How do alcohols affect living beings?

  When large quantities of ethanol are consumed, it tends to slow metabolic processes and to
depress the central nervous system. This results in lack of coordination, mental confusion,
drowsiness, lowering of the normal inhibitions, and ﬁnally stupor.   The individual may feel
relaxed  without  realising  that  his  sense  of  judgement,  sense  of  timing,  and  muscular
coordination have been seriously impaired.
  Unlike ethanol, intake of methanol in very small quantities can cause death. Methanol is
oxidised to methanal in the liver. Methanal reacts rapidly with the components of cells. It
coagulates the protoplasm, in much the same way an egg is coagulated by cooking. Methanol
also affects the optic nerve, causing blindness. Ethanol is an important industrial solvent. To
prevent the misuse of ethanol produced for industrial use, it is made unﬁt for drinking by
adding poisonous substances like methanol to it. Dyes are also added to colour the alcohol blue
so that it can be identiﬁed easily. This is called denatured alcohol.

Alcohol as a fuel

  Sugarcane plants are one of the most efficient convertors of sunlight into chemical
energy. Sugarcane juice can be used to prepare molasses which is fermented to give alcohol
(ethanol). Some countries now use alcohol as an additive in petrol since it is a cleaner fuel
which gives rise to only carbon dioxide and water on burning in sufficient air (oxygen).

4.4.2 Properties of Ethanoic Acid

  Ethanoic  acid  is  commonly  called  acetic
acid  and  belongs  to  a  group  of  acids  called
carboxylic acids. 5-8% solution of acetic acid
in water is called vinegar and is used widely as a
preservative  in  pickles.  The  melting  point  of
pure ethanoic acid is 290 K and hence it often
freezes  during  winter  in  cold  climates.  This
gave rise to its name glacial acetic acid.
  The  group  of  organic  compounds  called
carboxylic acids are obviously characterised by
their  acidic  nature.  However,  unlike  mineral
acids like HCl, which are completely ionised,
carboxylic acids are weak acids.

Compare  the  pH  of  dilute  acetic  acid
and dilute hydrochloric acid using both
litmus paper and universal indicator.

Are both acids indicated by the litmus
test?

Does the universal indicator show them
as equally strong acids?

How do alcohols affect living beings?

  When large quantities of ethanol are consumed, it tends to slow metabolic processes and to

depress the central nervous system. This results in lack of coordination, mental confusion,

drowsiness, lowering of the normal inhibitions, and ﬁnally stupor.   The individual may feel

relaxed  without  realising  that  his  sense  of  judgement,  sense  of  timing,  and  muscular

coordination have been seriously impaired.

  Unlike ethanol, intake of methanol in very small quantities can cause death. Methanol is

oxidised to methanal in the liver. Methanal reacts rapidly with the components of cells. It

coagulates the protoplasm, in much the same way an egg is coagulated by cooking. Methanol

also affects the optic nerve, causing blindness. Ethanol is an important industrial solvent. To

prevent the misuse of ethanol produced for industrial use, it is made unﬁt for drinking by

adding poisonous substances like methanol to it. Dyes are also added to colour the alcohol blue

so that it can be identiﬁed easily. This is called denatured alcohol.

Alcohol as a fuel

  Sugarcane plants are one of the most efficient convertors of sunlight into chemical

energy. Sugarcane juice can be used to prepare molasses which is fermented to give alcohol

(ethanol). Some countries now use alcohol as an additive in petrol since it is a cleaner fuel

which gives rise to only carbon dioxide and water on burning in sufficient air (oxygen).

4.4.2 Properties of Ethanoic Acid

  Ethanoic  acid  is  commonly  called  acetic

Compare  the  pH  of  dilute  acetic  acid

acid  and  belongs  to  a  group  of  acids  called

and dilute hydrochloric acid using both

carboxylic acids. 5-8% solution of acetic acid

litmus paper and universal indicator.

Are both acids indicated by the litmus

test?

Does the universal indicator show them

as equally strong acids?

in water is called vinegar and is used widely as a

preservative  in  pickles.  The  melting  point  of

pure ethanoic acid is 290 K and hence it often

freezes  during  winter  in  cold  climates.  This

gave rise to its name glacial acetic acid.

  The  group  of  organic  compounds  called

carboxylic acids are obviously characterised by

their  acidic  nature.  However,  unlike  mineral

acids like HCl, which are completely ionised,

carboxylic acids are weak acids.

Take  1  mL  ethanol  (absolute  alcohol)
and 1 mL glacial acetic acid along with a
few  drops  of  concentrated  sulphuric
acid in a test tube.

Warm  in  a  water-bath  for  at  least  ﬁve
minutes as shown in Fig. 4.11.

P o u r   i n t o   a   b e a k e r   c o n t a i n i n g
20-50  mL  of  water  and  smell  the
resulting mixture.

  Reactions of ethanoic acid:

(i)  Esteriﬁcation  reaction:  Esters  are  most
commonly formed by reaction of an acid and an
alcohol.  Ethanoic  acid  reacts  with  absolute
ethanol  in  the  presence  of  an  acid  catalyst  to
give an ester –

  Generally,  esters  are  sweet-smelling
substances. These are used in making perfumes
and  as  ﬂavouring  agents.  On  treating  with
sodium hydroxide, which is an alkali, the ester
is converted back to  alcohol and sodium salt of
carboxylic  acid.  This  reaction  is  known  as
saponiﬁcation  because  it  is  used  in  the
preparation  of  soap.  Soaps  are  sodium  or
potassium salts of long chain carboxylic acid.

(ii)  Reaction  with  a  base:  Like  mineral
acids, ethanoic acid reacts with a base such as
sodium  hydroxide  to  give  a  salt  (sodium
ethanoate or commonly called sodium acetate)
and water:
 NaOH + CH COOH ® CH COONa + H O
How  does  ethanoic  acid  react  with
carbonates and hydrogencarbonates?
Let us perform an activity to ﬁnd out.

Figure 4.11
Formation of ester

Set  up  the  apparatus  as  shown  in
Chapter 2, Activity 2.5.

Take a spatula full of sodium carbonate
in  a  test  tube  and  add  2  mL  of  dilute
ethanoic acid.

What do you observe?

Pass the gas produced through freshly
prepared  lime-water.  What  do  you
observe?

Can  the  gas  produced  by  the  reaction
between  ethanoic  acid  and  sodium
carbonate be identiﬁed by this test?

Repeat  this  Activity  with  sodium
hydrogencarbonate  instead  of  sodium
carbonate.

(iii)  Reaction  with  carbonates  and
hydrogencarbonates: Ethanoic acid reacts with
carbonates and hydrogencarbonates to give rise
to  a  salt,  carbon  dioxide  and  water.  The  salt
produced is commonly called sodium acetate.

give an ester –

Take a spatula full of sodium carbonate

in  a  test  tube  and  add  2  mL  of  dilute

  Generally,  esters  are  sweet-smelling

substances. These are used in making perfumes

and  as  ﬂavouring  agents.  On  treating  with

sodium hydroxide, which is an alkali, the ester

is converted back to  alcohol and sodium salt of

carboxylic  acid.  This  reaction  is  known  as

saponiﬁcation  because  it  is  used  in  the

preparation  of  soap.  Soaps  are  sodium  or

potassium salts of long chain carboxylic acid.

(ii)  Reaction  with  a  base:  Like  mineral

acids, ethanoic acid reacts with a base such as

sodium  hydroxide  to  give  a  salt  (sodium

ethanoate or commonly called sodium acetate)

and water:

Can  the  gas  produced  by  the  reaction

between  ethanoic  acid  and  sodium

Repeat  this  Activity  with  sodium

hydrogencarbonate  instead  of  sodium

carbonate.

(iii)  Reaction  with  carbonates  and

hydrogencarbonates: Ethanoic acid reacts with

carbonates and hydrogencarbonates to give rise

to  a  salt,  carbon  dioxide  and  water.  The  salt

produced is commonly called sodium acetate.

4.5  SOAPS  AND  DETERGENTS

Take about 10 mL of water each in two
test tubes.

Add a drop of oil (cooking oil) to both
the test tubes and label them as A and B.

To test tube B, add a few drops of soap
solution.

Can  you  see  the  oil  and  water  layers
separately  in  both  the  test  tubes
immediately  after  you  stop  shaking
them?

Leave  the  test  tubes  undisturbed  for
some  time  and  observe.  Does  the  oil
layer  separate  out?  In  which  test  tube
does this happen ﬁrst?

Figure 4.12 Formation of micelles

  This activity demonstrates the effect of soap
in cleaning. Most dirt is oily in nature and as
you know, oil does not dissolve in water. The
molecules  of  soap  are  sodium  or  potassium
salts of long-chain carboxylic acids. The ionic-
end  of  soap  interacts  with  water  while  the
carbon  chain  interacts  with  oil.  The  soap
molecules, thus form structures called micelles
(see Fig. 4.12) where one end of the molecules
is towards the oil droplet while the ionic-end
faces outside. This forms an emulsion in water.
The soap micelle thus helps  in pulling out the
dirt in water and we can wash our clothes clean
(Fig. 4.13).
  Can you draw the structure of the micelle
that would be formed if you dissolve soap in a
hydrocarbon?

Micelles

  Soaps are molecules in which the two ends have diﬀering properties, one is hydrophilic,
that is, it interacts with water, while the other end is hydrophobic, that is, it interacts with
hydrocarbons. When soap is at the surface of water, the hydrophobic ‘tail’ of soap will not
be soluble in water and the soap will align along the surface of water with the ionic end in
water and the hydrocarbon ‘tail’ protruding out of water. Inside   water, these molecules
have  a  unique  orientation  that  keeps  the  hydrocarbon  portion  out  of  the  water.  Thus,

Have you ever observed while bathing that
foam is formed with d
iffi
culty and an insoluble
substance (scum) remains after washing with
water? This is caused by the reaction of soap
with the calcium and magnesium salts, which
cause the hardness of water. Hence you need to
use a larger amount of soap. This problem is
overcome by using another class of compounds
called detergents as cleansing agents.
Detergents are generally sodium salts of
sulphonic acids or ammonium salts with
chlorides or bromides ions, etc. Both have long
hydrocarbon chain. The charged ends of these
compounds do not form insoluble precipitates
with the calcium and magnesium ions in hard
ctive in hard
water. Thus, they remain
water. Detergents are usually used to make
shampoos and products for cleaning clothes.

effe

1. Would you be able to check if water is

hard by using a detergent?

2. People use a variety of methods to

wash clothes. Usually after adding the

soap, they ‘beat’ the clothes on a stone,

or beat it with a paddle, scrub with a

brush or the mixture is agitated in a

washing machine. Why is agitation

necessary to get clean clothes?

?

Take about 10 mL of distilled water (or
rain water) and 10 mL of hard water
(from a tubewell or hand-pump) in
separate test tubes.

Add a couple of drops of soap solution
to both.

Shake the test tubes vigorously for an
equal period of time and observe the
amount of foam formed.

In which test tube do you get more
foam?

In which test tube do you observe a
white curdy precipitate?

Note for the teacher: If hard water is not
available in your locality, prepare some
h a r d w a t e r b y d i s s o l v i n g
hydrogencarbonates / sulphates /
chlorides of calcium or magnesium in
water.

Take two test tubes with about 10 mL of
hard water in each.

Add ﬁve drops of soap solution to one
and ﬁve drops of detergent solution to
the other.

Shake both test tubes for the same
period.

Do both test

■ Carbon is a versatile element that forms the basis for all living organisms and many of

the things we use.

■ This large variety of compounds is formed by carbon because of its tetravalency and the

property of catenation that it exhibits.

■ Covalent bonds are formed by the sharing of electrons between two atoms so that both

can achieve a completely ﬁlled outermost shell.

■ Carbon forms covalent bonds with itself and other elements such as hydrogen, oxygen,

sulphur, nitrogen and chlorine.

■ Carbon also forms compounds containing double and triple bonds between carbon
atoms. These carbon chains may be in the form of straight chains, branched chains or
rings.

■ The ability of carbon to form chains gives rise to a homologous series of compounds in

which the same functional group is attached to carbon chains of different lengths.

■ The  functional  groups  such  as  alcohols,  aldehydes,  ketones  and  carboxylic  acids

bestow characteristic properties to the carbon compounds that contain them.

■ Carbon and its compounds are some of our major sources of fuels.
■ Ethanol and ethanoic acid are carbon compounds of importance in our daily lives.
■ The action of soaps and detergents is based on the presence of both hydrophobic and
hydrophilic  groups  in  the  molecule  and  this  helps  to  emulsify  the  oily  dirt  and  hence  its
removal.

■ Carbon is a versatile element that forms the basis for all living organisms and many of

the things we use.

■ This large variety of compounds is formed by carbon because of its tetravalency and the

property of catenation that it exhibits.

■ Covalent bonds are formed by the sharing of electrons between two atoms so that both

can achieve a completely ﬁlled outermost shell.

■ Carbon forms covalent bonds with itself and other elements such as hydrogen, oxygen,

sulphur, nitrogen and chlorine.

■ Carbon also forms compounds containing double and triple bonds between carbon

atoms. These carbon chains may be in the form of straight chains, branched chains or

rings.

■ The ability of carbon to form chains gives rise to a homologous series of compounds in

which the same functional group is attached to carbon chains of different lengths.

■ The  functional  groups  such  as  alcohols,  aldehydes,  ketones  and  carboxylic  acids

bestow characteristic properties to the carbon compounds that contain them.

■ Carbon and its compounds are some of our major sources of fuels.

■ Ethanol and ethanoic acid are carbon compounds of importance in our daily lives.

■ The action of soaps and detergents is based on the presence of both hydrophobic and

hydrophilic  groups  in  the  molecule  and  this  helps  to  emulsify  the  oily  dirt  and  hence  its

removal.

II      Take about 20 mL of castor oil/cotton seed oil/linseed oil/soyabean oil in a beaker.
Add 30 mL of 20 % sodium hydroxide solution. Heat the mixture with continuous
stirring for a few minutes till the mixture thickens. Add 5-10 g of common salt to
this. Stir the mixture well and allow it to cool.

           You can cut out the soap in fancy shapes. You can also add perfume to the soap before

it sets.

e see a variety of objects in the world

Waround us. However, we are unable to

see anything in a dark room. On lighting up the
room,  things  become  visible.  What  makes
things  visible?  During  the  day,  the  sunlight
helps us to see objects. An object reﬂects light
that  falls  on  it.  This  reﬂected  light,  when
received by our eyes, enables us to see things.
We  are  able  to  see  through  a  transparent
medium as light is transmitted through it. There
a r e   a   n u m b e r   o f   c o m m o n   w o n d e r f u l
phenomena associated with light such as image
formation by mirrors, the twinkling of stars, the
beautiful colours of a rainbow, bending of light
by  a  medium  and  so  on.  A  study  of  the
properties of light helps us to explore them.

By  observing  the  common  optical
phenomena around us, we may conclude that
light seems to travel in straight lines. The fact
that a small source of light casts a sharp shadow
of an opaque object points to this straight-line
path of light, usually indicated as a ray of light.

If  an  opaque  object  on  the  path  of  light
becomes very small, light has a tendency
to bend around it and not walk in a straight
line – an eﬀect known as the diﬀraction of
light. Then the straight-line treatment of
optics  using  rays  fails.  To  explain
phenomena  such  as  diﬀraction,  light  is
thought of as a wave, the details of which
you will study in higher classes. Again, at
the  beginning  of  the  20th  century,  it
became  known  that  the  wave  theory  of
light  often  becomes  inadequate  for
treatment of the interaction of light with

166

matter, and light often behaves somewhat
like a stream of particles. This confusion
about the true nature of light continued for
some years till a modern quantum theory
of light emerged in which light is neither a
‘wave’ nor a ‘particle’ – the new theory
reconciles the particle properties of light
with the wave nature.

In this Chapter, we shall study the phenomena
of  reﬂection  and  refraction  of  light  using  the
straight-line propagation of light. These basic
concepts will help us in the study of some of the
optical  phenomena  in  nature.  We  shall  try  to
understand in this Chapter the reﬂection of light
by spherical mirrors and refraction of light and
their application in real life situations.

9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT

A  highly  polished  surface,  such  as  a
mirror, reﬂects most of the light falling on it.
You  are  already  familiar  with  the  laws  of
reﬂection of light.

Let us recall these laws –

     (i)  The angle of incidence is equal to the

angle of reﬂection, and

     (ii)  The  incident  ray,  the  normal  to  the
mirror at the point of incidence and the
reﬂected ray, all lie in the same plane.

These laws of reﬂection are applicable
to  all  types  of  reﬂecting  surfaces  including
spherical  surfaces.  You  are  familiar  with  the
formation of image by a plane mirror. What are
the properties of the image? Image formed by a
plane mirror is always virtual and erect.

The  size  of  the  image  is  equal  to  that  of  the
object.   The image formed is as far behind the
mirror as the object is in front of it.  Further, the
image  is  laterally  inverted.  How  would  the
images  be  when  the  reﬂecting  surfaces  are
curved? Let us explore.

■ Take  a  large  shining  spoon.  Try  to
view your face in its curved surface.
■ Do you get the image?  Is it smaller or

larger?

■ Move  the  spoon  slowly  away  from
your  face.  Observe  the  image.  How
does it change?

■ Reverse  the  spoon  and  repeat  the
Activity.    How  does  the  image  look
like now?

■ Compare  the  characteristics  of  the

image on the two surfaces.

The curved surface of a shining spoon could be
considered  as  a  curved  mirror.  The  most
commonly  used  type  of  curved  mirror  is  the
spherical mirror.  The reﬂecting surface of such
mirrors can be considered to form a part of the
surface  of  a  sphere.  Such  mirrors,  whose
reﬂecting  surfaces  are  spherical,  are  called
spherical mirrors.   We shall now study about
spherical mirrors in some detail.

9.2 SPHERICAL MIRRORS
        The reﬂecting surface of a spherical mirror
may  be  curved  inwards  or  outwards.    A
spherical  mirror,  whose  reﬂecting  surface  is
curved inwards, that is, faces towards the centre

168

of  the  sphere,  is  called  a  concave  mirror.   A
spherical  mirror  whose  reﬂecting  surface  is
curved outwards, is called a convex mirror. The
schematic  representation  of  these  mirrors  is
shown  in  Fig.  9.1.  You  may  note  in  these
diagrams that the back of the mirror is shaded.

        You may now understand that the surface
o f   t h e   s p o o n   c u r v e d   i n w a r d s   c a n   b e
approximated  to  a  concave  mirror  and  the
surface  of  the  spoon  bulged  outwards  can  be
approximated to a convex mirror.

        Before  we  move  further  on  spherical
mirrors, we need to recognise and understand
the  meaning  of  a  few  terms. These  terms  are
commonly used in discussions about spherical
mirrors. The centre of the reﬂecting surface of a
spherical mirror is a point called the pole.  It lies
on the surface of the mirror.  The pole is usually
represented by the letter P.

The reﬂecting surface of a spherical mirror
forms  a  part  of  a  sphere.  This  sphere  has  a
centre.  This  point  is  called  the  centre  of
curvature  of  the  spherical  mirror.  It  is
represented by the letter C. Please note that the
centre of curvature is not a part of the mirror. It
lies outside its reﬂecting surface. The centre of
curvature of a concave mirror lies in front of it.
However, it lies behind the mirror in case of a
convex mirror. You may note this in Fig.9.2 (a)
and (b). The radius of the sphere of which the
reﬂecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a
part,  is  called  the  radius  of  curvature  of  the
mirror. It is represented by the letter R. You may
note that the distance PC is equal to the radius
of  curvature.  Imagine  a  straight  line  passing
through the pole and the centre of curvature of a
spherical mirror. This line is called the principal
axis. Remember that principal axis is normal to
the  mirror  at  its  pole.  Let  us  understand  an
important term related to mirrors, through an
Activity.

CAUTION:  Do  not  look  at  the  Sun
directly  or  even  into  a  mirror  reﬂecting
sunlight. It may damage your eyes.
■ Hold  a  concave  mirror  in  your  hand
and  direct  its  reﬂecting  surface
towards the Sun.

■ Direct the light reﬂected by the mirror
on to a sheet of paper held close to the
mirror.

■ Move  the  sheet  of  paper  back  and
forth  gradually  until  you  ﬁnd  on  the
paper  sheet  a  bright,  sharp  spot  of
light.

■ Hold the mirror and the paper in the
same position for a few minutes. What
do you observe? Why?

170

The  paper  at  ﬁrst  begins  to  burn
producing smoke. Eventually it may even catch
ﬁre. Why does it burn? The light from the Sun is
converged  at  a  point,  as  a  sharp,  bright  spot
bythe  mirror.  In  fact,  this  spot  of  light  is  the
image  of  the  Sun  on  the  sheet  of  paper. This
point  is  the  focus  of  the  concave  mirror. The
heat  produced  due  to  the  concentration  of
sunlight ignites the paper. The distance of this
image from the position of the mirror gives the
approximate value of focal length of the mirror.
Let us try to understand this observation

with the help of a ray diagram.

Observe Fig.9.2 (a) closely. A number of
rays parallel to the principal axis are falling on a
concave  mirror.  Observe  the  reﬂected  rays.
They are all meeting/intersecting at a point on
the principal axis of the mirror.   This point is
called the principal focus of the concave mirror.
Similarly, observe Fig. 9.2 (b). How are the rays
parallel  to  the  principal  axis,  reﬂected  by  a
convex  mirror?  The  reﬂected  rays  appear  to
come from a point on the principal axis. This
point is called the principal focus of the convex
mirror.  The  principal  focus  is  represented  by
the letter F. The distance between the pole and
the  principal  focus  of  a  spherical  mirror  is
called the focal length. It is represented by the
letter f.

The reﬂecting surface of a spherical mirror

The  paper  at  ﬁrst  begins  to  burn

converged  at  a  point,  as  a  sharp,  bright  spot

reﬂecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a

mirror. It is represented by the letter R. You may

note that the distance PC is equal to the radius

of  curvature.  Imagine  a  straight  line  passing

through the pole and the centre of curvature of a

spherical mirror. This line is called the principal

axis. Remember that principal axis is normal to

the  mirror  at  its  pole.  Let  us  understand  an

important term related to mirrors, through an

Activity.

CAUTION:  Do  not  look  at  the  Sun

Let us try to understand this observation

with the help of a ray diagram.

Observe Fig.9.2 (a) closely. A number of

rays parallel to the principal axis are falling on a

concave  mirror.  Observe  the  reﬂected  rays.

They are all meeting/intersecting at a point on

the principal axis of the mirror.   This point is

called the principal focus of the concave mirror.

Similarly, observe Fig. 9.2 (b). How are the rays

parallel  to  the  principal  axis,  reﬂected  by  a

convex  mirror?  The  reﬂected  rays  appear  to

come from a point on the principal axis. This

point is called the principal focus of the convex

mirror.  The  principal  focus  is  represented  by

the letter F. The distance between the pole and

the  principal  focus  of  a  spherical  mirror  is

called the focal length. It is represented by the

letter f.

The reﬂecting surface of a spherical mirror
is by-and-large spherical. The surface, then, has
a circular outline. The diameter of the reﬂecting
surface of spherical mirror is called its aperture.
In Fig.9.2, distance MN represents the aperture.
We shall consider in our discussion only such
spherical  mirrors  whose  aperture  is  much
smaller than its radius of curvature.

Is there a relationship between the radius
of curvature R, and focal length f, of a spherical
mirror?  For  spherical  mirrors  of  small
apertures, the radius of curvature is found to be
equal to twice the focal length. We put this as
R = 2f . This implies that the principal focus of a
spherical mirror lies midway between the pole
and centre of curvature.

9.2.1    Image  Formation  by  Spherical
Mirrors

You  have  studied  about  the  image
formation by plane mirrors. You also know the
nature, position and relative size of the images
formed by them. How about the images formed
by spherical mirrors? How can we locate the
image formed by a concave mirror for diﬀerent
positions of the object? Are the images real or
virtual? Are they enlarged, diminished or have
the  same  size? We  shall  explore  this  with  an
Activity.

You  have  already  learnt  a  way  of
determining the focal length of a concave
mirror. In Activity 9.2, you have seen that
the sharp bright spot of light you got on
the paper is, in fact, the image of the Sun.
It was a tiny, real, inverted image. You got
the  approximate  focal  length  of  the
concave mirror by measuring the distance
of the image from the mirror.

172

■ Take a concave mirror.   Find out its
approximate  focal  length  in  the  way
described above. Note down the value
of focal length. (You can also ﬁnd it
out  by  obtaining  image  of  a  distant
object on a sheet of paper.)

■ Mark a line on a Table with a chalk.
Place the concave mirror on a stand.
Place the stand over the line such that
its pole lies over the line.

■ Draw  with  a  chalk  two  more  lines
parallel to the previous line such that
the  distance  between  any  two
successive lines is equal to the focal
length of the mirror. These lines will
now correspond to the positions of the
points  P,  F  and  C,  respectively.
Remember – For a spherical mirror of
small  aperture,  the  principal  focus  F
lies mid-way between the pole P and
the centre of curvature C.

■ Keep  a  bright  object,  say  a  burning
candle,  at  a  position  far  beyond  C.
Place  a  paper  screen  and  move  it  in
front  of  the  mirror  till  you  obtain  a
sharp bright image of the candle ﬂame
on it.

■ Observe  the  image  carefully.    Note
down its nature, position and relative

mirror?  For  spherical  mirrors  of  small

■ Draw  with  a  chalk  two  more  lines

The reﬂecting surface of a spherical mirror

is by-and-large spherical. The surface, then, has

a circular outline. The diameter of the reﬂecting

surface of spherical mirror is called its aperture.

In Fig.9.2, distance MN represents the aperture.

We shall consider in our discussion only such

spherical  mirrors  whose  aperture  is  much

smaller than its radius of curvature.

Is there a relationship between the radius

of curvature R, and focal length f, of a spherical

apertures, the radius of curvature is found to be

equal to twice the focal length. We put this as

R = 2f . This implies that the principal focus of a

spherical mirror lies midway between the pole

and centre of curvature.

9.2.1    Image  Formation  by  Spherical

Mirrors

You  have  studied  about  the  image

formation by plane mirrors. You also know the

nature, position and relative size of the images

formed by them. How about the images formed

by spherical mirrors? How can we locate the

image formed by a concave mirror for diﬀerent

positions of the object? Are the images real or

virtual? Are they enlarged, diminished or have

the  same  size? We  shall  explore  this  with  an

Activity.

You  have  already  learnt  a  way  of

determining the focal length of a concave

mirror. In Activity 9.2, you have seen that

the sharp bright spot of light you got on

the paper is, in fact, the image of the Sun.

It was a tiny, real, inverted image. You got

the  approximate  focal  length  of  the

concave mirror by measuring the distance

of the image from the mirror.

172

■ Take a concave mirror.   Find out its

approximate  focal  length  in  the  way

described above. Note down the value

of focal length. (You can also ﬁnd it

out  by  obtaining  image  of  a  distant

object on a sheet of paper.)

■ Mark a line on a Table with a chalk.

Place the concave mirror on a stand.

Place the stand over the line such that

its pole lies over the line.

parallel to the previous line such that

the  distance  between  any  two

successive lines is equal to the focal

length of the mirror. These lines will

now correspond to the positions of the

points  P,  F  and  C,  respectively.

Remember – For a spherical mirror of

small  aperture,  the  principal  focus  F

lies mid-way between the pole P and

the centre of curvature C.

■ Keep  a  bright  object,  say  a  burning

candle,  at  a  position  far  beyond  C.

Place  a  paper  screen  and  move  it  in

front  of  the  mirror  till  you  obtain  a

sharp bright image of the candle ﬂame

on it.

■ Observe  the  image  carefully.    Note

down its nature, position and relative

size with respect to the object size.

■ Repeat  the  activity  by  placing  the

c a n d l e   –   ( a )   j u s t   b e y o n d   C ,

(b) at C, (c) between F and C, (d) at F,

and (e) between P and F.

■ In one of the cases, you may not get

the image on the screen. Identify the

position of the object in such a case.

Then, look for its virtual image in the

You will see in the above Activity that the
nature, position and size of the image formed
by a concave mirror depends on the position of
the object in relation to points P, F and C. The
image formed is real for some positions of the
object. It is found to be a virtual image for a
certain  other  position.  The  image  is  either
magniﬁed,  reduced  or  has  the  same  size,
depending  on  the  position  of  the  object.  A
summary  of  these  observations  is  given  for
your reference in Table 9.1.

object,  an  arbitrarily  large  number  of  rays
emanating from a point could be considered.
However,  it  is  more  convenient  to  consider
only two rays, for the sake of clarity of the ray
diagram. These rays are so chosen that it is easy
to know their directions after reﬂection from
the mirror.

The  intersection  of  at  least  two  reﬂected
rays  give  the  position  of  image  of  the  point
object.   Any two of the following rays can be
considered for locating the image.

Consider  an  extended  object,  of  ﬁnite  size,

source.  An  inﬁnite  number  of  rays  originate
from each of these points. To construct the ray

diagram. These rays are so chosen that it is easy

depending  on  the  position  of  the  object.  A

summary  of  these  observations  is  given  for

your reference in Table 9.1.

The  intersection  of  at  least  two  reﬂected

rays  give  the  position  of  image  of  the  point

object.   Any two of the following rays can be

considered for locating the image.

axis, towards a point P (pole of the mirror), on
the concave mirror [Fig. 9.6 (a)] or a convex
mirror [Fig. 9.6 (b)], is reﬂected obliquely. The
incident and reﬂected rays follow the laws of
reﬂection  at  the  point  of  incidence  (point  P),
making equal angles with the principal axis.

the same path.  This is illustrated in Fig.9.5 (a)

way that the angle of reﬂection equals the angle
of incidence.

(ii)   A ray passing through the principal focus

of a concave mirror or a ray which is directed

towards the principal focus of a convex mirror,

after  reﬂection,  will  emerge  parallel  to  the

principal axis. This is illustrated in Fig.9.4 (a)

and (b).

(b)

Figure 9.5

(a)

(iv)   A ray incident obliquely to the principal

axis, towards a point P (pole of the mirror), on

the concave mirror [Fig. 9.6 (a)] or a convex

mirror [Fig. 9.6 (b)], is reﬂected obliquely. The

incident and reﬂected rays follow the laws of

reﬂection  at  the  point  of  incidence  (point  P),

making equal angles with the principal axis.

(b)

Figure 9.4

(iii)  A  ray  passing  through  the  centre  of

curvature of a concave mirror or directed in the

direction of the centre of curvature of a convex

mirror, after reﬂection, is reﬂected back along

the same path.  This is illustrated in Fig.9.5 (a)

and  (b).  The  light  rays  come  back  along  the

same path because the incident rays fall on the

mirror  along  the  normal  to  the  reﬂecting

surface.

(b)

Figure 9.6

         Remember that in all the above cases the

laws of reﬂection are followed. At the point of

incidence, the incident ray is reﬂected in such a

way that the angle of reﬂection equals the angle

of incidence.

Uses of concave mirrors

Concave  mirrors  are  commonly  used  in
torches,  search-lights  and  vehicles  headlights
to get powerful parallel beams of light. They
are often used as shaving mirrors to see a larger
image  of  the  face.  The  dentists  use  concave
mirrors  to  see  large  images  of  the  teeth  of
patients.  Large  concave  mirrors  are  used  to
concentrate  sunlight  to  produce  heat  in  solar
furnaces.

■ Take a convex mirror.   Hold it in one

hand.

■ Hold a pencil in the upright position in

the other hand.

■ Observe the image of the pencil in the
mirror. Is the image erect or inverted?
Is it diminished or enlarged?

■ Move the pencil away from the mirror
slowly.  Does  the  image  become
smaller or larger?

■ Repeat  this Activity  carefully.    State
whether the image will move closer to
or farther away from the focus as the
object is moved away from the mirror?

  We consider two positions of the object for
studying the image formed by a convex mirror.
First  is  when  the  object  is  at  inﬁnity  and  the
second position is when the object is at a ﬁnite
distance from the mirror. The ray diagrams for
the formation of image by a convex mirror for
these two positions of the object are shown in
Fig.9.8 (a) and (b), respectively.  The results are
summarised in Table 9.2.

      You have so far studied the image formation
by  a  plane  mirror,  a  concave  mirror  and  a
convex mirror. Which of these mirrors will give
the full image of a large object? Let us explore
through an Activity.

■ Observe the image of a distant object,
say a distant tree, in a plane mirror.
■ Could you see a full-length image?
■ Try  with  plane  mirrors  of  different
sizes. Did you see the entire object in

  You  can  see  a  full-length  image  of  a  tall
building/tree  in  a  small  convex  mirror.  One
such mirror is ﬁtted in a wall of Agra Fort facing
Taj  Mahal.  If  you  visit  the Agra  Fort,  try  to
observe the full image of Taj Mahal. To view
distinctly,  you  should  stand  suitably  at  the
terrace adjoining the wall.

Uses of convex mirrors

Convex mirrors are commonly used as
rear-view  (wing)  mirrors  in  vehicles.  These
mirrors  are  ﬁtted  on  the  sides  of  the  vehicle,
enabling the driver to see traﬃc behind him/her
to  facilitate  safe  driving.  Convex  mirrors  are
preferred  because  they  always  give  an  erect,
though  diminished,  image. Also,  they  have  a
wider ﬁeld of view as they are curved outwards.
Thus, convex mirrors enable the driver to view
much larger area than would be possible with a
plane mirror.

1.  Deﬁne the principal focus of a concave

  mirror.

2.  The radius of curvature of a spherical

  mirror is 20 cm.  What is its focal

length?

3.  Name a mirror that can give an erect

 and enlarged image of an object.

4.  Why do we prefer a convex mirror as a

 rear-view mirror in vehicles?

?

9.2.3  Sign  Convention  for  Reﬂection  by
Spherical Mirrors

While dealing with the reﬂection of light
by spherical mirrors, we shall follow a set of
sign conventions called the New Cartesian Sign
Convention. In this convention, the pole (P) of
the mirror is taken as the origin (Fig. 9.9).  The
principal axis of the mirror is taken as the x-axis
(X’X)  of  the  coordinate  system.  The
conventions are as follows –

(i)  The object is always placed to the left of
the mirror. This implies that the light from
the object falls on the mirror from the left-
hand side.

(ii)  All distances parallel to the principal axis

are measured from the pole of the mirror.

(iii)  All the distances measured to the right of
the  origin  (along  +  x-axis)  are  taken  as
positive while those measured to the left
of the origin (along – x-axis) are taken as
negative.

(iv)  Distances measured perpendicular to and
above the principal axis (along + y-axis)
are taken as positive.

(v)  Distances measured perpendicular to and
below the principal axis (along –y-axis)
are taken as negative.

The  New  Cartesian  Sign  Convention
described  above  is  illustrated  in  Fig.9.9  for
your  reference.  These  sign  conventions  are
applied to obtain the mirror formula and solve
related numerical problems.

the mirror. This implies that the light from

the object falls on the mirror from the left-

hand side.

(ii)  All distances parallel to the principal axis

are measured from the pole of the mirror.

(iii)  All the distances measured to the right of

the  origin  (along  +  x-axis)  are  taken  as

positive while those measured to the left

the object size. It is expressed as the ratio of the
height of the image to the height of the object. It
is usually represented by the letter m.

If h is the height of the object and h  is the
height  of  the  image,  then  the  magniﬁcation  m
produced by a spherical mirror is given by

m =

Height of the object (

m =

The magniﬁcation m is also related to the
object distance (u) and image distance (v).  It can
be expressed as:

Magniﬁcation (m)  =

h
h

(9.3)

You may note that the height of the object is
taken  to  be  positive  as  the  object  is  usually
placed above the principal axis.   The height of
the image should be taken as positive for virtual
images.   However, it is to be taken as negative
for real images. A negative sign in the value of
the magniﬁcation indicates that the image is real.
A positive sign in the value of the magniﬁcation
indicates that the image is virtual.

Example 9.1

A  convex  mirror  used  for  rear-view  on  an
automobile has a radius of curvature of 3.00 m. If
a bus is located at 5.00 m from this mirror, ﬁnd

The New Cartesian Sign Convention for

9.2.4  Mirror Formula and  Magniﬁcation

In a spherical mirror, the distance of the
object from its pole is called the object distance
(u).  The distance of the image from the pole of
the mirror is called the image distance (v). You
already know that the distance of the principal
focus from the pole is called the focal length (f).
There  is  a  relationship  between  these  three
quantities given by the mirror formula which is
expressed as

1
v

+

1
u

=

1
f

(9.1)

This  formula  is  valid  in  all  situations  for  all
spherical mirrors for all positions of the object.
You  must  use  the  New  Cartesian  Sign
Convention  while  substituting  numerical
values for u, v, f, and R in the mirror formula for
solving problems.

Magniﬁcation

Magniﬁcation produced by a spherical
mirror  gives  the  relative  extent  to  which  the
image of an object is magniﬁed with respect to

9.3 REFRACTION OF LIGHT

Light seems to travel along straight-line
paths in a transparent medium.  What happens
when light enters from one transparent medium
to another? Does it still move along a straight-
line path or change its direction? We shall recall
some of our day-to-day experiences.

You might have observed that the bottom
of a tank or a pond containing water appears to
be raised. Similarly, when a thick glass slab is
placed  over  some  printed  matter,  the  letters
appear  raised  when  viewed  through  the  glass
slab.  Why  does  it  happen?  Have  you  seen  a
pencil  partly  immersed  in  water  in  a  glass
tumbler?  It  appears  to  be  displaced  at  the
interface  of  air  and  water.  You  might  have
observed that a lemon kept in water in a glass
tumbler appears to be bigger than its actual size,
when  viewed  from  the  sides.  How  can  you
account for such experiences?

Let  us  consider  the  case  of  the  apparent
displacement  of  a  pencil,  partly  immersed  in
water. The light reaching you from the portion
of the pencil inside water seems to come from a
different direction, compared to the part above
water.  This  makes  the  pencil  appear  to  be
displaced at the interface. For similar reasons,
the  letters  appear  to  be  raised,  when  seen
through a glass slab placed over it.

Does a pencil appear to be displaced to the
same extent, if instead of water, we use liquids
like  kerosene  or  turpentine?  Will  the  letters
appear to rise to the same height if we replace a
glass slab with a transparent plastic slab? You
will ﬁnd that the extent of the effect is different
for different pair of media. These observations
indicate that light does not travel in the same
direction  in  all  media.  It  appears  that  when
travelling  obliquely  from  one  medium  to
another, the direction of propagation of light in
the second medium changes. This phenomenon
is  known  as  refraction  of  light.  Let  us
understand this phenomenon further by doing a
few activities.

188

■ Place a coin at the bottom of a bucket

ﬁlled with water.

■ With your eye to a side above water, try
to pick up the coin in one go. Did you
succeed in picking up the coin?

■ Repeat  the Activity. Why  did  you  not

succeed in doing it in one go?

■ Ask  your  friends  to  do  this.  Compare

your experience with theirs.

■ Place a large shallow bowl on a Table

and put a coin in it.

■ Move away slowly from the bowl.  Stop
when the coin just disappears from your
sight.

■ Ask a friend to pour water gently into
the bowl without disturbing the coin.
■ Keep  looking  for  the  coin  from  your
position. Does the coin becomes visible
again from your position?   How could
this happen?

The  coin  becomes  visible  again  on
pouring water into the bowl. The coin appears
slightly raised above its actual position due to
refraction of light.

■ Draw a thick straight line in ink, over a
sheet of white paper placed on a Table.
■ Place a glass slab over the line in such a
way that one of its edges makes an angle
with the line.

■ Look at the portion of the line under the
slab  from  the  sides.  What  do  you
observe? Does the line under the glass
slab appear to be bent at the edges?

■ Next, place the glass slab such that it is
normal to the line. What do you observe
now? Does the part of the line under the
glass slab appear bent?

■ Look at the line from the top of the glass
slab. Does the part of the line, beneath
the slab, appear to be raised? Why does
this happen?

9.3.1  Refraction  through  a  Rectangular
Glass Slab
To understand the phenomenon of refraction of
light through a glass slab, let us do an Activity.

the normal. At O , the light ray has entered from
glass to air, that is, from a denser medium to a
rarer medium.   The light here has bent away
from  the  normal.  Compare  the  angle  of
incidence with the angle of refraction at both
refracting surfaces AB and CD.

I

I

In Fig. 9.10, a ray EO is obliquely incident
on surface AB, called incident ray. OO  is the
refracted ray and O  H is the emergent ray. You
may observe that the emergent ray is parallel to
the direction of the incident ray. Why does it
happen so? The extent of bending of the ray of
light at the opposite parallel faces AB (air-glass
interface)  and  CD  (glass-air  interface)  of  the
rectangular  glass  slab  is  equal  and  opposite.
This  is  why  the  ray  emerges  parallel  to  the
incident ray. However, the light ray is shifted
sideward slightly. What happens when a light
ray is incident normally to the interface of two
media? Try and ﬁnd out.

■ Fix a sheet of white paper on a drawing

board using drawing pins.

■ Place a rectangular glass slab over the

sheet in the middle.

■ Draw  the  outline  of  the  slab  with  a
pencil.  Let  us  name  the  outline  as
ABCD.

■ Take four identical pins.
■ Fix  two  pins,  say  E  and  F,  vertically
such  that  the  line  joining  the  pins  is
inclined to the edge AB.

■ Look for the images of the pins E and F
through  the  opposite  edge.    Fix  two
other pins, say G and H, such that these
pins and the images of E and F lie on a
straight line.

■ Remove the pins and the slab.
■ Join the positions of tip of the pins E and
F and produce the line up to AB. Let EF
meet  AB  at  O.    Similarly,  join  the
positions of tip of the pins G and H and
produce it up to the edge CD.   Let HG
I
meet CD at O .

Join O and O .  Also produce EF up to P,
as shown by a dotted line in Fig. 9.10.

9.3.1  Refraction  through  a  Rectangular

Glass Slab

To understand the phenomenon of refraction of

light through a glass slab, let us do an Activity.

■ Fix a sheet of white paper on a drawing

board using drawing pins.

■ Place a rectangular glass slab over the

sheet in the middle.

■ Draw  the  outline  of  the  slab  with  a

pencil.  Let  us  name  the  outline  as

ABCD.

■ Take four identical pins.

■ Fix  two  pins,  say  E  and  F,  vertically

such  that  the  line  joining  the  pins  is

inclined to the edge AB.

■ Look for the images of the pins E and F

through  the  opposite  edge.    Fix  two

other pins, say G and H, such that these

pins and the images of E and F lie on a

straight line.

■ Remove the pins and the slab.

■ Join the positions of tip of the pins E and

F and produce the line up to AB. Let EF

meet  AB  at  O.    Similarly,  join  the

positions of tip of the pins G and H and

produce it up to the edge CD.   Let HG

meet CD at O .

Join O and O .  Also produce EF up to P,

as shown by a dotted line in Fig. 9.10.

In this Activity, you will note, the light ray

has  changed  its  direction  at  points  O  and  O . I

Note  that  both  the  points  O  and  O   lie  on

I

surfaces  separating  two  transparent  media.

Draw  a  perpendicular  NN’  to  AB  at  O  and

another  perpendicular  MM   to  CD  at  O . The

I

I

light  ray  at  point  O  has  entered  from  a  rarer

medium to a denser medium, that is, from air to

glass. Note that the light ray has bent towards

190

the normal. At O , the light ray has entered from

I

glass to air, that is, from a denser medium to a

rarer medium.   The light here has bent away

from  the  normal.  Compare  the  angle  of

incidence with the angle of refraction at both

refracting surfaces AB and CD.

In Fig. 9.10, a ray EO is obliquely incident

on surface AB, called incident ray. OO  is the

I

refracted ray and O  H is the emergent ray. You

I

may observe that the emergent ray is parallel to

the direction of the incident ray. Why does it

happen so? The extent of bending of the ray of

light at the opposite parallel faces AB (air-glass

interface)  and  CD  (glass-air  interface)  of  the

rectangular  glass  slab  is  equal  and  opposite.

This  is  why  the  ray  emerges  parallel  to  the

incident ray. However, the light ray is shifted

sideward slightly. What happens when a light

ray is incident normally to the interface of two

media? Try and ﬁnd out.

The  following  are  the  laws  of  refraction  of
light.

(i)   The incident ray, the refracted ray and the
normal to the interface of two transparent
media at the point of incidence, all lie in the
same plane.

(ii)  The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the
sine of angle of refraction is a constant, for
the light of a given colour and for the given
pair  of  media. This  law  is  also  known  as
Snell’s law of refraction. (This is true for
angle 0 < i < 90 )

o

If i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of
refraction, then,

sin
sin

i
r

= constant

(9.4)

This constant value is called the refractive
index of the second medium with respect to the
ﬁrst.    Let  us  study  about  refractive  index  in
some detail.

9.3.2 The Refractive Index

You have already studied that a ray of
light that travels obliquely from one transparent
medium into another will change its direction
in the second medium. The extent of the change
in direction that takes place in a given pair of
media  may  be  expressed  in  terms  of  the
refractive  index,  the  “constant”  appearing  on
the right-hand side of Eq.(9.4).

1.2.5 Oxidation and Reduction

The refractive index can be linked to an
important physical quantity, the relative speed
of  propagation  of  light  in  different  media.  It
turns  out  that  light  propagates  with  different
speeds in different media. Light travels fastest
in vacuum with speed of 3×10  m s .  In air, the
speed of light is only marginally less, compared

–1

8

192

?

to  that  in  vacuum.  It  reduces  considerably  in
glass or water. The value of the refractive index
for  a  given  pair  of  media  depends  upon  the
speed of light in the two media, as given below.

1

  Consider  a  ray  of  light  travelling  from
medium 1 into medium 2, as shown in Fig.9.11.
Let v be the speed of light in medium 1 and v
2
be  the  speed  of  light  in  medium  2.  The
refractive  index  of  medium  2  with  respect  to
medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of
light  in  medium  1  and  the  speed  of  light  in
medium 2. This is usually represented by the
symbol  n .  This  can  be  expressed  in  an
equation form as

21

n =
21

Speed of light in medium 1
Speed of light in medium 2

=

v
1
v

2

(9.5)

Figure 9.11

  By the same argument, the refractive index
of  medium  1  with  respect  to  medium  2  is
represented as n . It is given by
12

n =
12

Speed of light in medium 2
Speed of light in medium 1

=

v
2
v
1

(9.6)

If medium 1 is vacuum or air, then the
refractive index of medium 2 is considered with
respect to vacuum.   This is called the absolute
refractive index of the medium.   It is  simply
represented as n . If c is the speed of light in air

Let v be the speed of light in medium 1 and v

be  the  speed  of  light  in  medium  2.  The

refractive  index  of  medium  2  with  respect  to

medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of

light  in  medium  1  and  the  speed  of  light  in

This constant value is called the refractive

some detail.

9.3.2 The Refractive Index

You have already studied that a ray of

light that travels obliquely from one transparent

medium into another will change its direction

in the second medium. The extent of the change

in direction that takes place in a given pair of

media  may  be  expressed  in  terms  of  the

The refractive index can be linked to an

important physical quantity, the relative speed

n =

12

of  propagation  of  light  in  different  media.  It

turns  out  that  light  propagates  with  different

speeds in different media. Light travels fastest

in vacuum with speed of 3×10  m s .  In air, the

8

speed of light is only marginally less, compared

represented as n . It is given by

If medium 1 is vacuum or air, then the

refractive index of medium 2 is considered with

respect to vacuum.   This is called the absolute

refractive index of the medium.   It is  simply

represented as n . If c is the speed of light in air

refractive  index  of  several  media  is  given  in
Table 9.3. From the Table you can know that the
refractive index of water, n  = 1.33. This means
that the ratio of the speed of light in air and the

  Note from Table 9.3 that an optically denser
medium may not possess greater mass density.
For example, kerosene having higher refractive
index, is optically denser than water, although
its mass density is less than water.

194

The  ability  of  a  medium  to  refract  light  is
also expressed in terms of its optical density.
Optical density has a deﬁnite connotation.  It
is  not  the  same  as  mass  density.  We  have
been  using  the  terms  ‘rarer  medium’  and
‘denser medium’ in this Chapter. It actually
means  ‘optically  rarer  medium’  and
‘optically  denser  medium’,  respectively.
When can we say that a medium is optically
denser  than  the  other?  In  comparing  two
media,  the  one  with  the  larger  refractive
index  is  optically  denser  medium  than  the
other.  The other medium of lower refractive
index is optically rarer.  The speed of light is
higher  in  a  rarer  medium  than  a  denser
medium. Thus, a ray of light travelling from
a rarer medium to a  denser medium slows
down and bends  towards the normal. When
it  travels  from  a  denser  medium  to  a  rarer
medium, it speeds up and bends away from
the normal.

1.  A  ray  of  light  travelling  in  air  enters
obliquely into water. Does the light ray
bend towards the normal or away from
the normal? Why?

2.  Light  enters  from  air  to  glass  having
refractive index 1.50. What is the speed
of light in the glass? The speed of light in
–1
vacuum is 3 × 10  m s .

8

3.  Find  out,  from  Table  9.3,  the  medium
having highest optical density.  Also ﬁnd
the medium with lowest optical density.

4.  You  are  given  kerosene,  turpentine  and
water.  In  which  of  these  does  the  light
travel fastest? Use the information given
in Table 9.3.

5.  The refractive index of diamond is 2.42.
What is the meaning of this statement?

  Note from Table 9.3 that an optically denser

medium may not possess greater mass density.

For example, kerosene having higher refractive

index, is optically denser than water, although

its mass density is less than water.

194

The  ability  of  a  medium  to  refract  light  is

also expressed in terms of its optical density.

Optical density has a deﬁnite connotation.  It

is  not  the  same  as  mass  density.  We  have

been  using  the  terms  ‘rarer  medium’  and

‘denser medium’ in this Chapter. It actually

means  ‘optically  rarer  medium’  and

‘optically  denser  medium’,  respectively.

denser  than  the  other?  In  comparing  two

media,  the  one  with  the  larger  refractive

index  is  optically  denser  medium  than  the

other.  The other medium of lower refractive

index is optically rarer.  The speed of light is

higher  in  a  rarer  medium  than  a  denser

medium. Thus, a ray of light travelling from

a rarer medium to a  denser medium slows

down and bends  towards the normal. When

it  travels  from  a  denser  medium  to  a  rarer

medium, it speeds up and bends away from

1.  A  ray  of  light  travelling  in  air  enters

obliquely into water. Does the light ray

bend towards the normal or away from

the normal? Why?

2.  Light  enters  from  air  to  glass  having

refractive index 1.50. What is the speed

of light in the glass? The speed of light in

vacuum is 3 × 10  m s .

–1

3.  Find  out,  from  Table  9.3,  the  medium

having highest optical density.  Also ﬁnd

the medium with lowest optical density.

4.  You  are  given  kerosene,  turpentine  and

water.  In  which  of  these  does  the  light

travel fastest? Use the information given

in Table 9.3.

5.  The refractive index of diamond is 2.42.

9.3.3 Refraction by Spherical Lenses

You  might  have  seen  watchmakers
using a small magnifying glass to see tiny parts.
Have  you  ever  touched  the  surface  of  a
magnifying  glass  with  your  hand?  Is  it  plane
surface or curved? Is it thicker in the middle or
at the edges? The glasses used in spectacles and
that by a watchmaker are examples of lenses.
What is a lens? How does it bend light rays? We
shall discuss these in this section.

A  transparent  material  bound  by  two
surfaces,  of  which  one  or  both  surfaces  are
spherical, forms a lens. This means that a lens is
bound by at least one spherical surface. In such
lenses, the other surface would be plane.  A lens
may  have  two  spherical  surfaces,  bulging
outwards. Such a lens is called a double convex
lens.  It  is  simply  called  a  convex  lens.  It  is
thicker at the middle as compared to the edges.
Convex lens converges light rays as shown in
Fig.  9.12  (a).  Hence  convex  lenses  are  also
called converging lenses.   Similarly, a double
concave  lens  is  bounded  by  two  spherical
surfaces, curved inwards.   It is thicker at the
edges than at the middle. Such lenses diverge
light rays as shown in Fig. 9.12 (b). Such lenses
are  also  called  diverging  lenses.  A  double
concave lens is simply called a concave lens.

A lens, either a convex lens or a concave lens,
has  two  spherical  surfaces.  Each  of  these
surfaces forms a part of a sphere. The centres of
these spheres are called centres of curvature of
the lens.   The centre of curvature of a lens is
usually represented by the letter C.  Since there
are two centres of curvature, we may represent
them as C  and C . An imaginary straight line
passing through the two centres of curvature of
a  lens  is  called  its  principal  axis. The  central
point of a lens is its optical centre. It is usually
represented  by  the  letter  O.  A  ray  of  light
through  the  optical  centre  of  a  lens  passes
without suﬀering any deviation. The eﬀective
diameter of the circular outline of a spherical
lens is called its aperture. We shall conﬁne our
discussion in this Chapter to such lenses whose
aperture  is  much  less  than  its  radius  of
curvature and the two centres of curvatures are
equidistant  from  the  optical  centre  O.  Such
lenses  are  called  thin  lenses  with  small
apertures. What happens when parallel rays of
light  are  incident  on  a  lens?    Let  us  do  an
Activity to understand this.

9.3.3 Refraction by Spherical Lenses

You  might  have  seen  watchmakers

using a small magnifying glass to see tiny parts.

Have  you  ever  touched  the  surface  of  a

magnifying  glass  with  your  hand?  Is  it  plane

surface or curved? Is it thicker in the middle or

at the edges? The glasses used in spectacles and

that by a watchmaker are examples of lenses.

What is a lens? How does it bend light rays? We

shall discuss these in this section.

A  transparent  material  bound  by  two

surfaces,  of  which  one  or  both  surfaces  are

(b)

Figure 9.12

(a) Converging action of a convex lens,

(b) diverging action of a concave lens

A lens, either a convex lens or a concave lens,

spherical, forms a lens. This means that a lens is

has  two  spherical  surfaces.  Each  of  these

bound by at least one spherical surface. In such

surfaces forms a part of a sphere. The centres of

lenses, the other surface would be plane.  A lens

may  have  two  spherical  surfaces,  bulging

outwards. Such a lens is called a double convex

lens.  It  is  simply  called  a  convex  lens.  It  is

thicker at the middle as compared to the edges.

Convex lens converges light rays as shown in

Fig.  9.12  (a).  Hence  convex  lenses  are  also

called converging lenses.   Similarly, a double

concave  lens  is  bounded  by  two  spherical

these spheres are called centres of curvature of

the lens.   The centre of curvature of a lens is

usually represented by the letter C.  Since there

are two centres of curvature, we may represent

them as C  and C . An imaginary straight line

1

2

passing through the two centres of curvature of

a  lens  is  called  its  principal  axis. The  central

point of a lens is its optical centre. It is usually

surfaces, curved inwards.   It is thicker at the

represented  by  the  letter  O.  A  ray  of  light

edges than at the middle. Such lenses diverge

through  the  optical  centre  of  a  lens  passes

light rays as shown in Fig. 9.12 (b). Such lenses

are  also  called  diverging  lenses.  A  double

concave lens is simply called a concave lens.

without suﬀering any deviation. The eﬀective

diameter of the circular outline of a spherical

lens is called its aperture. We shall conﬁne our

discussion in this Chapter to such lenses whose

aperture  is  much  less  than  its  radius  of

curvature and the two centres of curvatures are

equidistant  from  the  optical  centre  O.  Such

lenses  are  called  thin  lenses  with  small

apertures. What happens when parallel rays of

light  are  incident  on  a  lens?    Let  us  do  an

Activity to understand this.

CAUTION: Do not look at the Sun directly
or through a lens while doing this Activity
or otherwise. You may damage your eyes if
you do so.
■ Hold a convex lens in your hand. Direct

it towards the Sun.

■ Focus the light from the Sun on a sheet
of paper. Obtain a sharp bright image of
the Sun.

■ Hold the paper and the lens in the same
position for a while.   Keep observing
the  paper.  What  happened?  Why?
Recall your experience in Activity 9.2.

The  paper  begins  to  burn  producing
smoke.  It  may  even  catch  ﬁre  after  a  while.
Why does this happen? The light from the Sun
constitutes  parallel  rays  of  light.   These  rays
were converged by the lens at the sharp bright
spot formed on the paper.   In fact, the bright
spot you got on the paper is a real image of the
Sun. The concentration of the sunlight at a point
generated heat.  This caused the paper to burn.

Now,  we  shall  consider  rays  of  light
parallel to the principal axis of a lens.   What
happens  when  you  pass  such  rays  of  light
through a lens?  This is illustrated for a convex
lens in Fig.9.12 (a) and for a concave lens in
Fig.9.12 (b).

  Observe  Fig.9.12  (a)  carefully.  Several
rays  of  light  parallel  to  the  principal  axis  are
falling  on  a  convex  lens.  These  rays,  after
refraction  from  the  lens,  are  converging  to  a
point  on  the  principal axis. This  point  on  the
principal axis is called the principal focus of the
lens.  Let  us  see  now  the  action  of  a  concave
lens.

  Observe  Fig.9.12  (b)  carefully.  Several
rays  of  light  parallel  to  the  principal  axis  are
falling  on  a  concave  lens.  These  rays,  after
refraction  from  the  lens,  are  appearing  to
diverge from a point on the principal axis. This
point on the principal axis is called the principal
focus of the concave lens.

1

If you pass parallel rays from the opposite
surface  of  the  lens,  you  get  another  principal
focus on the opposite side. Letter F is usually
used to represent principal focus. However, a
lens  has  two  principal  foci.    They  are
represented by F  and F . The distance of the
principal focus from the optical centre of a lens
is called its focal length. The letter f  is used to
represent the focal length. How can you ﬁnd the
focal  length  of  a  convex  lens?  Recall  the
Activity  9.11.  In  this  Activity,  the  distance
between the position of the lens and the position
of the image of the Sun gives the approximate
focal length of the lens.

9.3.4 Image Formation by Lenses

Lenses form images by refracting light. How do
lenses form images? What is their nature? Let
us study this for a convex lens ﬁrst.

■ Ta k e   a   c o n v e x   l e n s .     F i n d   i t s
approximate  focal  length  in  a  way
described in Activity 9.11.

■ Draw ﬁve parallel straight lines, using
chalk,  on  a  long  Table  such  that  the
distance between the successive lines is
equal to the focal length of the lens.
■ Place the lens on a lens stand.   Place it
on the central line such that the optical
centre of the lens lies just over the line.

CAUTION: Do not look at the Sun directly

or through a lens while doing this Activity

  Observe  Fig.9.12  (b)  carefully.  Several

rays  of  light  parallel  to  the  principal  axis  are

falling  on  a  concave  lens.  These  rays,  after

refraction  from  the  lens,  are  appearing  to

or otherwise. You may damage your eyes if

diverge from a point on the principal axis. This

■ Focus the light from the Sun on a sheet

of paper. Obtain a sharp bright image of

the Sun.

■ Hold the paper and the lens in the same

position for a while.   Keep observing

the  paper.  What  happened?  Why?

Recall your experience in Activity 9.2.

The  paper  begins  to  burn  producing

smoke.  It  may  even  catch  ﬁre  after  a  while.

Why does this happen? The light from the Sun

If you pass parallel rays from the opposite

surface  of  the  lens,  you  get  another  principal

focus on the opposite side. Letter F is usually

used to represent principal focus. However, a

lens  has  two  principal  foci.    They  are

represented by F  and F . The distance of the

principal focus from the optical centre of a lens

is called its focal length. The letter f  is used to

represent the focal length. How can you ﬁnd the

focal  length  of  a  convex  lens?  Recall  the

Activity  9.11.  In  this  Activity,  the  distance

between the position of the lens and the position

constitutes  parallel  rays  of  light.   These  rays

of the image of the Sun gives the approximate

Lenses form images by refracting light. How do

lenses form images? What is their nature? Let

us study this for a convex lens ﬁrst.

Now,  we  shall  consider  rays  of  light

parallel to the principal axis of a lens.   What

happens  when  you  pass  such  rays  of  light

through a lens?  This is illustrated for a convex

Fig.9.12 (b).

  Observe  Fig.9.12  (a)  carefully.  Several

rays  of  light  parallel  to  the  principal  axis  are

falling  on  a  convex  lens.  These  rays,  after

refraction  from  the  lens,  are  converging  to  a

point  on  the  principal axis. This  point  on  the

principal axis is called the principal focus of the

lens.  Let  us  see  now  the  action  of  a  concave

described in Activity 9.11.

■ Draw ﬁve parallel straight lines, using

chalk,  on  a  long  Table  such  that  the

distance between the successive lines is

equal to the focal length of the lens.

■ The two lines on either side of the lens
correspond  to  F  and  2F  of  the  lens
respectively.    Mark  them  with

■ Place a burning candle, far beyond 2F  1
to the left. Obtain a clear sharp image on
a screen on the opposite side of the lens.
■ Note  down  the  nature,  position  and

relative size of the image.

■ Repeat this Activity by placing object

Let  us  now  do  an  Activity  to  study  the
nature, position and relative size of the image
formed by a concave lens.

■ Take  a  concave  lens.  Place  it  on  a

lens stand.

■ Place a burning candle on one side of

the lens.

■ Look through the lens from the other
side and observe the image.   Try to
get the image on a screen, if possible.
If  not,  observe  the  image  directly
through the lens.

■ Note  down  the  nature,  relative  size
and  approximate  position  of  the
image.

■ Move the candle away from the lens.
Note  the  change  in  the  size  of  the
image. What happens to the size of
the image when the candle is placed
too far away from the lens.

The summary of the above Activity is given in
Table 9.5 below.

Activity? A  concave  lens  will  always  give  a
virtual,  erect  and  diminished  image,
irrespective of the position of the object.

9.3.5 Image Formation in Lenses Using Ray
Diagrams

 We can represent image formation by lenses
using  ray  diagrams.  Ray  diagrams  will  also
help us to study the nature, position and relative
size of the image formed by lenses. For drawing
ray  diagrams  in  lenses,  alike  of  spherical
mirrors, we consider any two of the following
rays –

(i)       A ray of light from the object, parallel to
the principal axis, after refraction from a
convex lens, passes through the principal
focus  on  the  other  side  of  the  lens,  as
shown  in  Fig.  9.13  (a).  In  case  of  a
concave lens, the ray appears to diverge
from  the  principal  focus  located  on  the
same  side  of  the  lens,  as  shown  in  Fig.
9.13 (b).

(ii)  A ray of light passing through a principal
focus, after refraction from a convex lens,
will emerge parallel to the principal axis.
This  is  shown  in  Fig.  9.14  (a). A  ray  of
light  appearing  to  meet  at  the  principal
focus of a concave lens, after refraction,
will emerge parallel to the principal axis.
This is shown in Fig.9.14 (b).

9.3.6 Sign Convention for Spherical Lenses

For lenses, we follow sign convention, similar
to the one used for spherical mirrors. We apply
the rules for signs of distances, except that all
measurements are taken from the optical centre
of  the  lens. According  to  the  convention,  the
focal length of a convex lens is positive and that
of  a  concave  lens  is  negative. You  must  take
care to apply appropriate signs for the values of

I
u, v, f, object height h and image height h .

9.3.7 Lens Formula and Magniﬁcation

As we have a formula for spherical mirrors, we
also  have  formula  for  spherical  lenses.  This
formula gives the relationship between object-
distance (u), image-distance (v) and the focal
length (f).  The lens formula is expressed as

1
v

−

1
u

=

1
f

(9.8)

The  lens  formula  given  above  is  general
and is valid in all situations for any spherical
lens. Take proper care of the signs of different
quantities, while putting numerical values for
solving problems relating to lenses.

Magniﬁcation
The magniﬁcation produced by a lens, similar
to that for spherical mirrors, is deﬁned as the
ratio of the height of the image and the height of
the object. Magniﬁcation is represented by the
letter m. If h is the height of the object and h  is

I

the height of the image given by a lens, then the
magniﬁcation produced by the lens is given by,

  Magniﬁcation  produced  by  a  lens  is  also
related to the object-distance u, and the image-
distance v. This relationship is given by

Magniﬁcation (m) = h / h = v/u

I

(9.10)

Example 9.3

A concave lens has focal length of 15 cm. At
what distance should the object from the lens be
placed so that it forms an image at 10 cm from
the lens? Also, ﬁnd the magniﬁcation produced
by the lens.

Solution

A  concave  lens  always  forms  a  virtual,  erect
image on the same side of the object.

A 2.0 cm tall object is placed perpendicular to
the  principal  axis  of  a  convex  lens  of  focal

The positive sign of v shows that the image is

inverted.

The negative signs of m and
 show that the
image is inverted and real. It is formed below
the principal axis. Thus, a real, inverted image,
4 cm tall, is formed at a distance of 30 cm on the
other side of the lens. The image is two times
enlarged.

9.3.8 Power of a Lens

You have already learnt that the ability of a lens
to converge or diverge light rays depends on its
focal  length.  For  example,  a  convex  lens  of
short focal length bends the light rays through
large  angles,  by  focussing  them  closer  to  the
optical centre. Similarly, concave lens of very
short  focal  length  causes  higher  divergence
than  the  one  with  longer  focal  length.  The
degree  of  convergence  or  divergence  of  light
rays achieved by a lens is expressed in terms of
its power. The power of a lens is deﬁned as the
reciprocal of its focal length. It is represented
by the letter P.  The power P of a lens of focal
length f is given by

P =

1
f

(9.11)

The SI unit of power of a lens is ‘dioptre’.
It is denoted by the letter D. If f is expressed in
metres,  then,  power  is  expressed  in  dioptres.
Thus, 1 dioptre is the power of a lens whose
focal length is 1 metre. 1D = 1m . You may note
that the power of a convex lens is positive and
that of a concave lens is negative.

–1

Opticians  prescribe  corrective  lenses
indicating  their  powers.    Let  us  say  the  lens
prescribed has power equal to + 2.0 D.   This
means the lens prescribed is convex.  The focal
length of the lens is + 0.50 m. Similarly, a lens
of power – 2.5 D has a focal length of – 0.40 m.
The lens is concave.

Many  optical  instruments  consist  of  a
number of lenses. They are combined to
increase the magniﬁcation and sharpness
of  the  image.  The  net  power  (P)  of  the
lenses  placed  in  contact  is  given  by  the
algebraic sum of the individual powers P , 1
P , P , …   as

2

The  simple  additive  property  of  the
powers  of  lenses  can  be  used  to  design
lens systems to minimise certain defects
in images produced by a single lens.  Such
a lens system, consisting of several lenses,
in contact, is commonly used in the design
of  lenses  of  camera,  microscopes  and
telescopes.

P = P  + P  + P  + …

The  use  of  powers,  instead  of  focal
lengths, for lenses is quite convenient for
opticians. During eye-testing, an optician
puts  several  different  combinations  of
corrective  lenses  of  known  power,  in
contact,  inside  the  testing  spectacles’
frame. The optician calculates the power
of the lens required by simple algebraic
addition. For example, a combination of
two lenses of power  + 2.0 D and + 0.25 D
is  equivalent  to  a  single  lens  of  power
+ 2.25 D.

1.  Deﬁne 1 dioptre of power of a lens.
2.  A convex lens forms a real and inverted
image of a needle at a distance of 50 cm
from it.   Where is the needle placed in
front of the convex lens if the image is
equal to the size of the object? Also, ﬁnd
the power of the lens.

3.  Find the power of a concave lens of focal

length 2 m.

■ Light seems to travel in straight lines.
■ Mirrors  and  lenses  form  images  of  objects.  Images  can  be  either  real  or  virtual,

depending on the position of the object.

■ The reﬂecting surfaces, of all types, obey the laws of reﬂection. The refracting surfaces

obey the laws of refraction.

■ New Cartesian Sign Conventions are followed for spherical mirrors and lenses.

ou have studied in the previous chapter

Yabout  refraction  of  light  by  lenses. You

also  studied  the  nature,  position  and  relative
size of images formed by lenses. How can these
ideas help us in the study of the human eye? The
human  eye  uses  light  and  enables  us  to  see
objects around us. It has a lens in its structure.
What is the function of the lens in a human eye?
How  do  the  lenses  used  in  spectacles  correct
defects  of  vision?  Let  us  consider  these
questions in this chapter.

  We  have  learnt  in  the  previous  chapter
about light and some of its properties. In this
chapter, we shall use these ideas to study some
of the optical phenomena in nature. We shall
also discuss about rainbow formation, splitting
of white light and blue colour of the sky.

10.1 THE HUMAN EYE

The human eye is one of the most valuable
and sensitive sense organs. It enables us to see
the wonderful world and the colours around us.
On closing the eyes, we can identify objects to
some  extent  by  their  smell,  taste,  sound  they
make or by touch. It is, however, impossible to
identify colours while closing the eyes. Thus, of
all the sense organs, the human eye is the most
signiﬁcant  one  as  it  enables  us  to  see  the
beautiful, colourful world around us.

The human eye is like a camera.   Its lens
system  forms  an  image  on  a  light-sensitive
screen  called  the  retina.  Light  enters  the  eye
through a thin membrane called the cornea.  It
forms the transparent bulge on the front surface
of the eyeball as shown in Fig. 10.1. The eyeball
is  approximately  spherical  in  shape  with  a
diameter of about 2.3 cm. Most of the refraction
for the light rays entering the eye occurs at the
outer surface of the cornea. The crystalline lens
merely provides the ﬁner adjustment of focal
length  required  to  focus  objects  at  diﬀerent

218

If  an  opaque  object  on  the  path  of  light

becomes very small, light has a tendency

to bend around it and not walk in a straight

line – an eﬀect known as the diﬀraction of

light. Then the straight-line treatment of

optics  using  rays  fails.  To  explain

phenomena  such  as  diﬀraction,  light  is

thought of as a wave, the details of which

you will study in higher classes. Again, at

the  beginning  of  the  20th  century,  it

became  known  that  the  wave  theory  of

light  often  becomes  inadequate  for

treatment of the interaction of light with

distances  on  the  retina.  We  ﬁnd  a  structure
called  iris  behind  the  cornea.  Iris  is  a  dark
muscular  diaphragm  that  controls  the  size  of
the pupil.  The pupil regulates and controls the
amount of light entering the eye. The eye lens
forms an inverted real image of the object on
the  retina. The  retina  is  a  delicate  membrane
having  enormous  number  of  light-sensitive
cells.    The  light-sensitive  cells  get  activated
upon  illumination  and  generate  electrical
signals.  These signals are sent to the brain via
the  optic  nerves.    The  brain  interprets  these
signals, and ﬁnally, processes the information
so that we perceive objects as they are.

Figure 10.1 The human eye

10.1.1 Power of Accommodation

The eye lens is composed of a ﬁbrous, jelly-like
material. Its curvature can be modiﬁed to some
extent by the ciliary muscles. The change in the
curvature  of  the  eye  lens  can  thus  change  its
focal length. When the muscles are relaxed, the
lens  becomes  thin.  Thus,  its  focal  length
increases.  This enables us to see distant objects
clearly. When you are looking at objects closer
to  the  eye,  the  ciliary  muscles  contract.  This
increases the curvature of the eye lens. The eye
lens  then  becomes  thicker.  Consequently,  the
focal  length  of  the  eye  lens  decreases.    This
enables us to see nearby objects clearly.

  We  have  learnt  in  the  previous  chapter

about light and some of its properties. In this

chapter, we shall use these ideas to study some

of the optical phenomena in nature. We shall

also discuss about rainbow formation, splitting

of white light and blue colour of the sky.

10.1 THE HUMAN EYE

The human eye is one of the most valuable

and sensitive sense organs. It enables us to see

the wonderful world and the colours around us.

On closing the eyes, we can identify objects to

some  extent  by  their  smell,  taste,  sound  they

make or by touch. It is, however, impossible to

identify colours while closing the eyes. Thus, of

all the sense organs, the human eye is the most

signiﬁcant  one  as  it  enables  us  to  see  the

beautiful, colourful world around us.

The human eye is like a camera.   Its lens

system  forms  an  image  on  a  light-sensitive

screen  called  the  retina.  Light  enters  the  eye

through a thin membrane called the cornea.  It

forms the transparent bulge on the front surface

of the eyeball as shown in Fig. 10.1. The eyeball

is  approximately  spherical  in  shape  with  a

diameter of about 2.3 cm. Most of the refraction

for the light rays entering the eye occurs at the

outer surface of the cornea. The crystalline lens

merely provides the ﬁner adjustment of focal

length  required  to  focus  objects  at  diﬀerent

218

Figure 10.1 The human eye

10.1.1 Power of Accommodation

The eye lens is composed of a ﬁbrous, jelly-like

material. Its curvature can be modiﬁed to some

extent by the ciliary muscles. The change in the

curvature  of  the  eye  lens  can  thus  change  its

focal length. When the muscles are relaxed, the

lens  becomes  thin.  Thus,  its  focal  length

increases.  This enables us to see distant objects

clearly. When you are looking at objects closer

to  the  eye,  the  ciliary  muscles  contract.  This

increases the curvature of the eye lens. The eye

lens  then  becomes  thicker.  Consequently,  the

focal  length  of  the  eye  lens  decreases.    This

enables us to see nearby objects clearly.

If  an  opaque  object  on  the  path  of  light

becomes very small, light has a tendency

to bend around it and not walk in a straight

line – an eﬀect known as the diﬀraction of

light. Then the straight-line treatment of

optics  using  rays  fails.  To  explain

phenomena  such  as  diﬀraction,  light  is

thought of as a wave, the details of which

you will study in higher classes. Again, at

the  beginning  of  the  20th  century,  it

became  known  that  the  wave  theory  of

light  often  becomes  inadequate  for

treatment of the interaction of light with

The  ability  of  the  eye  lens  to  adjust  its
focal  length  is  called  accommodation.
However, the focal length of the eye lens cannot
be decreased below a certain minimum limit.
Try to read a printed page by holding it very
close to your eyes. You may see the image being
blurred or feel strain in the eye. To see an object
comfortably and distinctly, you must hold it at
about  25  cm  from  the  eyes.    The  minimum
distance,  at  which  objects  can  be  seen  most
distinctly  without  strain,  is  called  the  least
distance of distinct vision. It is also called the
near point of the eye. For a young adult with
normal  vision,  the  near  point  is  about
25 cm. The farthest point upto which the eye
can see objects clearly is called the far point of
the eye. It is inﬁnity for a normal eye. You may
note here a normal eye can see objects clearly
that are between 25 cm and inﬁnity.

Sometimes, the crystalline lens of people
at  old  age  becomes  milky  and  cloudy.  This
condition is called cataract. This causes partial
or  complete  loss  of  vision.  It  is  possible  to
restore vision through a cataract surgery.

10.2  DEFECTS  OF  VISION AND  THEIR
CORRECTION

Sometimes, the eye may gradually lose
its  power  of  accommodation.    In  such
conditions,  the  person  cannot  see  the  objects
distinctly and comfortably. The vision becomes
blurred due to the refractive defects of the eye.

There are mainly three common refractive
defects of vision. These are (i) myopia or near-
sightedness,  (ii)  Hypermetropia  or  far-
sightedness,  and  (iii)  Presbyopia.    These
defects can be corrected by the use of suitable
spherical  lenses.  We  discuss  below  these
defects and their correction.

220

(a)  Myopia

Myopia  is  also  known  as  near-
sightedness.  A  person  with  myopia  can  see
nearby  objects  clearly  but  cannot  see  distant
objects distinctly. A person with this defect has
the far point nearer than inﬁnity. Such a person
may see clearly upto a distance of a few metres.
In a myopic eye, the image of a distant object is
formed in front of the retina [Fig. 10.2 (b)] and
not at the retina itself.   This defect may arise
due to (i) excessive curvature of the eye lens, or
(ii) elongation of the eyeball. This defect can be
corrected by using a concave lens of suitable
power.  This  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  10.2  (c).  A
concave lens of suitable power will bring the
image back on to the retina and thus the defect
is corrected.

Figure 10.2
(a), (b) The myopic eye, and (c) correction
 for myopia with a concave lens

(b) Hypermetropia

Hypermetropia  is  also  known  as  far-
sightedness. A person with hypermetropia can
see distant objects clearly but cannot see nearby
objects  distinctly.  The  near  point,  for  the
person,  is  farther  away  from  the  normal  near
point  (25  cm).  Such  a  person  has  to  keep  a
reading material much beyond 25 cm from the
eye for comfortable reading. This is because the

The  ability  of  the  eye  lens  to  adjust  its

(a)  Myopia

focal  length  is  called  accommodation.

Myopia  is  also  known  as  near-

Try to read a printed page by holding it very

objects distinctly. A person with this defect has

close to your eyes. You may see the image being

In a myopic eye, the image of a distant object is

about  25  cm  from  the  eyes.    The  minimum

formed in front of the retina [Fig. 10.2 (b)] and

distance,  at  which  objects  can  be  seen  most

not at the retina itself.   This defect may arise

distinctly  without  strain,  is  called  the  least

due to (i) excessive curvature of the eye lens, or

distance of distinct vision. It is also called the

(ii) elongation of the eyeball. This defect can be

near point of the eye. For a young adult with

corrected by using a concave lens of suitable

normal  vision,  the  near  point  is  about

power.  This  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  10.2  (c).  A

25 cm. The farthest point upto which the eye

note here a normal eye can see objects clearly

that are between 25 cm and inﬁnity.

Sometimes, the crystalline lens of people

at  old  age  becomes  milky  and  cloudy.  This

condition is called cataract. This causes partial

or  complete  loss  of  vision.  It  is  possible  to

restore vision through a cataract surgery.

■ Take  a  large  shining  spoon.  Try  to

view your face in its curved surface.

■ Do you get the image?  Is it smaller or

larger?

■ Move  the  spoon  slowly  away  from

your  face.  Observe  the  image.  How

does it change?

■ Reverse  the  spoon  and  repeat  the

Activity.    How  does  the  image  look

like now?

■ Compare  the  characteristics  of  the

image on the two surfaces.

Sometimes, the eye may gradually lose

its  power  of  accommodation.    In  such

Figure 10.2

conditions,  the  person  cannot  see  the  objects

distinctly and comfortably. The vision becomes

blurred due to the refractive defects of the eye.

There are mainly three common refractive

defects of vision. These are (i) myopia or near-

sightedness,  (ii)  Hypermetropia  or  far-

sightedness,  and  (iii)  Presbyopia.    These

defects can be corrected by the use of suitable

spherical  lenses.  We  discuss  below  these

defects and their correction.

(a), (b) The myopic eye, and (c) correction

 for myopia with a concave lens

(b) Hypermetropia

Hypermetropia  is  also  known  as  far-

sightedness. A person with hypermetropia can

see distant objects clearly but cannot see nearby

objects  distinctly.  The  near  point,  for  the

person,  is  farther  away  from  the  normal  near

point  (25  cm).  Such  a  person  has  to  keep  a

reading material much beyond 25 cm from the

eye for comfortable reading. This is because the

light rays from a closeby object are focussed at
a point behind the retina as shown in Fig. 10.3
(b).  This  defect  arises  either  because  (i)  the
focal length of the eye lens is too long, or (ii) the
eyeball has become too small. This defect can
be  corrected  by  using  a  convex  lens  of
appropriate  power.  This  is  illustrated  in  Fig.
10.3  (c).  Eye-glasses  with  converging  lenses
provide  the  additional  focussing  power
required for forming the image on the retina.

ciliary  muscles  and  diminishing  ﬂexibility  of
the eye lens.   Sometimes, a person may suﬀer
from  both  myopia  and  hypermetropia.    Such
people often require bi-focal lenses. A common
type of bi-focal lenses consists of both concave
and convex lenses.  The upper portion consists
of a concave lens. It facilitates distant vision.
The lower part is a convex lens.   It facilitates
near vision.

These  days,  it  is  possible  to  correct  the
refractive  defects  with  contact  lenses  or
through surgical interventions.

Do you know that our eyes can live even
after our death? By donating our eyes after
we  die,  we  can  light  the  life  of  a  blind
person.
About 35 million people in the developing
world are blind and most of them can be
cured.  About  4.5  million  people  with
corneal  blindness  can  be  cured  through
corneal  transplantation  of  donated  eyes.
Out of these 4.5 million, 60% are children
below the age of 12. So, if we have got the
gift  of  vision,  why  not  pass  it  on  to
somebody who does not have it? What do
we have to keep in mind when eyes have to
be donated?
■ Eye donors can belong to any age group
or sex. People who use spectacles, or
those  operated  for  cataract,  can  still
donate  the  eyes.  People  who  are
diabetic,  have  hypertension,  asthma
p a t i e n t s   a n d   t h o s e   w i t h o u t
communicable  diseases  can  also
donate eyes.

■ Eyes must be removed within 4-6 hours
after death. Inform the nearest eye bank
immediately.

■ The  eye  bank  team  will  remove  the
eyes at the home of the deceased or at a
hospital.

■ Eye removal takes only 10-15 minutes.
It is a simple process and does not lead
to any disﬁgurement.

■ Persons who were infected with or died
because  of  AIDS,  Hepatitis  B  or  C,
rabies,  acute  leukaemia,  tetanus,
cholera,  meningitis  or  encephalitis
cannot donate eyes.

224

An  eye  bank  collects,  evaluates  and
distributes  the  donated  eyes.  All  eyes
donated are evaluated using strict medical

10.3 REFRACTION OF LIGHT THROUGH
A PRISM

You have learnt how light gets refracted
through  a  rectangular  glass  slab.  For  parallel
refracting  surfaces,  as  in  a  glass  slab,  the
emergent  ray  is  parallel  to  the  incident  ray.
However, it is slightly displaced laterally. How
would light get refracted through a transparent
prism? Consider a triangular glass prism. It has
two  triangular  bases  and  three  rectangular
lateral surfaces. These surfaces are inclined to
each  other. The  angle  between  its  two  lateral
faces is called the angle of the prism. Let us now
do  an  activity  to  study  the  refraction  of  light
through a triangular glass prism.

■ Fix  a  sheet  of  white  paper  on  a
drawing board using drawing pins.
■ Place a glass prism on it in such a way
that  it  rests  on  its  triangular  base.
Trace the outline of the prism using a
pencil.

■ Draw a straight line PE inclined to one
of the refracting surfaces, say AB, of
the prism.

Do you know that our eyes can live even

after our death? By donating our eyes after

we  die,  we  can  light  the  life  of  a  blind

person.

About 35 million people in the developing

world are blind and most of them can be

cured.  About  4.5  million  people  with

corneal  blindness  can  be  cured  through

corneal  transplantation  of  donated  eyes.

Out of these 4.5 million, 60% are children

below the age of 12. So, if we have got the

gift  of  vision,  why  not  pass  it  on  to

somebody who does not have it? What do

we have to keep in mind when eyes have to

be donated?

■ Eye donors can belong to any age group

or sex. People who use spectacles, or

those  operated  for  cataract,  can  still

donate  the  eyes.  People  who  are

diabetic,  have  hypertension,  asthma

hospital.

■ Eye removal takes only 10-15 minutes.

It is a simple process and does not lead

to any disﬁgurement.

■ Persons who were infected with or died

because  of  AIDS,  Hepatitis  B  or  C,

rabies,  acute  leukaemia,  tetanus,

cholera,  meningitis  or  encephalitis

cannot donate eyes.

An  eye  bank  collects,  evaluates  and

distributes  the  donated  eyes.  All  eyes

donated are evaluated using strict medical

standards.  Those  donated  eyes  found

unsuitable for transplantation are used for

valuable research and medical education.

The  identities  of  both  the  donor  and  the

recipient remain conﬁdential.

■ Fix two pins, say at points P and Q, on
t h e   l i n e   P E   a s   s h o w n   i n
Fig. 10.4.

■ Look for the images of the pins, ﬁxed
at P and Q, through the other face AC.
■ Fix two more pins, at points R and S,
such that the pins at R and S and the
images of the pins at P and Q lie on the
same straight line.

■ Remove the pins and the glass prism.
■ The line PE meets the boundary of the
prism  at  point  (see  Fig.  10.4).
Similarly, join and produce the points
R  and  S.    Let  these  lines  meet  the
boundary  of  the  prism  at  E  and  F,
respectively.  Join E and F.

■ Draw perpendiculars to the refracting
surfaces AB  and AC  of  the  prism  at
points E and F, respectively.

■ Mark the angle of incidence (Ði), the
angle of refraction (Ðr) and the angle
of  emergence  (Ðe)  as  shown  in  Fig.
10.4.

Here PE is the incident ray, EF is the refracted
ray and FS is the emergent ray. You may note
that a ray of light is entering from air to glass at
the ﬁrst surface AB. The light ray on refraction
has  bent  towards  the  normal.  At  the  second
surface AC, the light ray has entered from glass
to  air.  Hence  it  has  bent  away  from  normal.
Compare the angle of incidence and the angle
of refraction at each refracting surface of the
prism. Is this similar to the kind of bending that
occurs in a glass slab? The peculiar shape of the
prism makes the emergent ray bend at an angle
to the direction of the incident ray. This angle is
called the angle of deviation. In this case ÐD is
the  angle  of  deviation.  Mark  the  angle  of
deviation in the above activity and measure it.

10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY
A GLASS PRISM

You must have seen and appreciated the
spectacular colours in a rainbow.   How could
the  white  light  of  the  Sun  give  us  various
colours of the rainbow? Before we take up this
question, we shall ﬁrst go back to the refraction
of light through a prism. The inclined refracting
surfaces  of  a  glass  prism  show  exciting
phenomenon.  Let  us  ﬁnd  it  out  through  an
activity.

■ Take  a  thick  sheet  of  cardboard  and
make a small hole or narrow slit in its
middle.

■ Allow sunlight to fall on the narrow
slit. This gives a narrow beam of white
light.

■ Remove the pins and the glass prism.

■ The line PE meets the boundary of the

prism  at  point  (see  Fig.  10.4).

Similarly, join and produce the points

R  and  S.    Let  these  lines  meet  the

boundary  of  the  prism  at  E  and  F,

respectively.  Join E and F.

■ Draw perpendiculars to the refracting

surfaces AB  and AC  of  the  prism  at

points E and F, respectively.

■ Mark the angle of incidence (Ði), the

angle of refraction (Ðr) and the angle

of  emergence  (Ðe)  as  shown  in  Fig.

10.4.

Here PE is the incident ray, EF is the refracted

ray and FS is the emergent ray. You may note

that a ray of light is entering from air to glass at

the ﬁrst surface AB. The light ray on refraction

has  bent  towards  the  normal.  At  the  second

surface AC, the light ray has entered from glass

to  air.  Hence  it  has  bent  away  from  normal.

Compare the angle of incidence and the angle

of refraction at each refracting surface of the

prism. Is this similar to the kind of bending that

occurs in a glass slab? The peculiar shape of the

prism makes the emergent ray bend at an angle

to the direction of the incident ray. This angle is

called the angle of deviation. In this case ÐD is

the  angle  of  deviation.  Mark  the  angle  of

deviation in the above activity and measure it.

You must have seen and appreciated the

the  white  light  of  the  Sun  give  us  various

colours of the rainbow? Before we take up this

question, we shall ﬁrst go back to the refraction

of light through a prism. The inclined refracting

surfaces  of  a  glass  prism  show  exciting

phenomenon.  Let  us  ﬁnd  it  out  through  an

■ Turn the prism slowly until the light
that  comes  out  of  it  appears  on  a
nearby screen.

■ What do you observe? You will ﬁnd a
beautiful band of colours. Why does
this happen?

The prism has probably split the incident
white  light  into  a  band  of  colours.    Note  the
colours that appear at the two ends of the colour
band. What is the sequence of colours that you
see on the screen? The various colours seen are
Violet,  Indigo,  Blue,  Green,  Yellow,  Orange
and Red, as shown in Fig. 10.5. The acronym
VIBGYOR  will  help  you  to  remember  the
sequence of colours. The band of the coloured
components  of  a  light  beam  is  called  its
spectrum. You might not be able to see all the
colours separately. Yet something makes each
colour distinct from the other. The splitting of
light  into  its  component  colours  is  called
dispersion.

Figure 10.5 Dispersion of white light by
the glass prism

  You have seen that white light is dispersed
into its seven-colour components by a prism.
Why do we get these colours? Diﬀerent colours
of  light  bend  through  diﬀerent  angles  with
respect to the incident ray, as they pass through
a prism. The red light bends the least while the

228

violet the most. Thus the rays of each colour
emerge along different paths and thus become
distinct. It is the band of distinct colours that we
see in a spectrum.

Isaac Newton was the ﬁrst to use a glass
prism  to  obtain  the  spectrum  of  sunlight.  He
tried  to  split  the  colours  of  the  spectrum  of
white  light  further  by  using  another  similar
prism.  However,  he  could  not  get  any  more
colours.  He  then  placed  a  second  identical
prism in an inverted position with respect to the
ﬁrst prism, as shown in Fig. 10.6. This allowed
all the colours of the spectrum to pass through
the  second  prism.  He  found  a  beam  of  white
light emerging from the other side of the second
prism. This observation gave Newton the idea
that the sunlight is made up of seven colours.

Figure 10.6 Recombination of the spectrum
                    of white light

  Any light that gives a spectrum similar to
that  of  sunlight  is  often  referred  to  as  white
light.

■ Turn the prism slowly until the light

that  comes  out  of  it  appears  on  a

nearby screen.

■ What do you observe? You will ﬁnd a

beautiful band of colours. Why does

this happen?

The prism has probably split the incident

white  light  into  a  band  of  colours.    Note  the

colours that appear at the two ends of the colour

band. What is the sequence of colours that you

see on the screen? The various colours seen are

Violet,  Indigo,  Blue,  Green,  Yellow,  Orange

and Red, as shown in Fig. 10.5. The acronym

VIBGYOR  will  help  you  to  remember  the

sequence of colours. The band of the coloured

components  of  a  light  beam  is  called  its

spectrum. You might not be able to see all the

colours separately. Yet something makes each

colour distinct from the other. The splitting of

light  into  its  component  colours  is  called

dispersion.

Figure 10.5 Dispersion of white light by

the glass prism

  You have seen that white light is dispersed

into its seven-colour components by a prism.

Why do we get these colours? Diﬀerent colours

of  light  bend  through  diﬀerent  angles  with

respect to the incident ray, as they pass through

a prism. The red light bends the least while the

228

violet the most. Thus the rays of each colour

emerge along different paths and thus become

distinct. It is the band of distinct colours that we

see in a spectrum.

Isaac Newton was the ﬁrst to use a glass

prism  to  obtain  the  spectrum  of  sunlight.  He

tried  to  split  the  colours  of  the  spectrum  of

white  light  further  by  using  another  similar

prism.  However,  he  could  not  get  any  more

colours.  He  then  placed  a  second  identical

prism in an inverted position with respect to the

ﬁrst prism, as shown in Fig. 10.6. This allowed

all the colours of the spectrum to pass through

the  second  prism.  He  found  a  beam  of  white

light emerging from the other side of the second

prism. This observation gave Newton the idea

that the sunlight is made up of seven colours.

Figure 10.6 Recombination of the spectrum

                    of white light

  Any light that gives a spectrum similar to

that  of  sunlight  is  often  referred  to  as  white

light.

A  rainbow  is  a  natural  spectrum
appearing in the sky after a rain shower (Fig.
10.7). It is caused by dispersion of sunlight by
tiny water droplets, present in the atmosphere.
A  rainbow  is  always  formed  in  a  direction
opposite to that of the Sun. The water droplets
act like small prisms. They refract and disperse
the incident sunlight, then reﬂect it internally,
and ﬁnally refract it again when it comes out of
the raindrop (Fig. 10.8). Due to the dispersion
of light and internal reﬂection, different colours
reach the observer’s eye.

Figure 10.8 Rainbow formation

You can also see a rainbow on a sunny
day  when  you  look  at  the  sky  through  a
waterfall or through a water fountain, with the
Sun behind you.

10.5 ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION

You might have observed the apparent
random wavering or ﬂickering of objects seen
through  a  turbulent  stream  of  hot  air  rising
above a ﬁre or a radiator. The air just above the
ﬁre becomes hotter than the air further up. The
hotter air is lighter (less dense) than the cooler
air above it, and has a refractive index slightly

230

less  than  that  of  the  cooler  air.  Since  the
physical  conditions  of  the  refracting  medium
(air) are not stationary, the apparent position of
the  object,  as  seen  through  the  hot  air,
ﬂuctuates.  This  wavering  is  thus  an  eﬀect  of
atmospheric  refraction  (refraction  of  light  by
the earth’s atmosphere) on a small scale in our
local environment. The twinkling of stars is a
similar  phenomenon  on  a  much  larger  scale.
Let us see how we can explain it.

Twinkling of stars

The  twinkling  of  a  star  is  due  to
atmospheric  refraction  of  starlight.  The
starlight,  on  entering  the  earth’s  atmosphere,
undergoes  refraction  continuously  before  it
reaches  the  earth. The  atmospheric  refraction
occurs  in  a  medium  of  gradually  changing
refractive  index.  Since  the  atmosphere  bends
starlight  towards  the  normal,  the  apparent
position of the star is slightly diﬀerent from its
actual position. The star appears slightly higher
(above)  than  its  actual  position  when  viewed
near  the  horizon  (Fig.  10.9).  Further,  this
apparent position of the star is not stationary,
but  keeps  on  changing  slightly,  since  the
physical conditions of the earth’s atmosphere
are  not  stationary,  as  was  the  case  in  the
previous  paragraph.  Since  the  stars  are  very
distant,  they  approximate  point-sized  sources
of light. As the path of rays of light coming from
the star goes on varying slightly, the apparent
position of the star ﬂuctuates and the amount of
starlight  entering  the  eye  ﬂickers  –  the  star
sometimes appears brighter, and at some other
time, fainter, which is the twinkling effect.

A  rainbow  is  a  natural  spectrum

less  than  that  of  the  cooler  air.  Since  the

appearing in the sky after a rain shower (Fig.

physical  conditions  of  the  refracting  medium

10.7). It is caused by dispersion of sunlight by

tiny water droplets, present in the atmosphere.

A  rainbow  is  always  formed  in  a  direction

opposite to that of the Sun. The water droplets

act like small prisms. They refract and disperse

the incident sunlight, then reﬂect it internally,

and ﬁnally refract it again when it comes out of

the raindrop (Fig. 10.8). Due to the dispersion

of light and internal reﬂection, different colours

reach the observer’s eye.

(air) are not stationary, the apparent position of

the  object,  as  seen  through  the  hot  air,

ﬂuctuates.  This  wavering  is  thus  an  eﬀect  of

atmospheric  refraction  (refraction  of  light  by

the earth’s atmosphere) on a small scale in our

local environment. The twinkling of stars is a

similar  phenomenon  on  a  much  larger  scale.

Let us see how we can explain it.

Twinkling of stars

The  twinkling  of  a  star  is  due  to

atmospheric  refraction  of  starlight.  The

starlight,  on  entering  the  earth’s  atmosphere,

undergoes  refraction  continuously  before  it

reaches  the  earth. The  atmospheric  refraction

occurs  in  a  medium  of  gradually  changing

refractive  index.  Since  the  atmosphere  bends

starlight  towards  the  normal,  the  apparent

position of the star is slightly diﬀerent from its

actual position. The star appears slightly higher

(above)  than  its  actual  position  when  viewed

near  the  horizon  (Fig.  10.9).  Further,  this

apparent position of the star is not stationary,

but  keeps  on  changing  slightly,  since  the

physical conditions of the earth’s atmosphere

are  not  stationary,  as  was  the  case  in  the

previous  paragraph.  Since  the  stars  are  very

distant,  they  approximate  point-sized  sources

of light. As the path of rays of light coming from

the star goes on varying slightly, the apparent

position of the star ﬂuctuates and the amount of

starlight  entering  the  eye  ﬂickers  –  the  star

sometimes appears brighter, and at some other

time, fainter, which is the twinkling effect.

Figure 10.8 Rainbow formation

You can also see a rainbow on a sunny

day  when  you  look  at  the  sky  through  a

waterfall or through a water fountain, with the

Sun behind you.

10.5 ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION

You might have observed the apparent

random wavering or ﬂickering of objects seen

through  a  turbulent  stream  of  hot  air  rising

above a ﬁre or a radiator. The air just above the

ﬁre becomes hotter than the air further up. The

hotter air is lighter (less dense) than the cooler

air above it, and has a refractive index slightly

10.6  SCATTERING OF LIGHT

The  interplay  of  light  with  objects  around  us
gives rise to several spectacular phenomena in
nature.  The  blue  colour  of  the  sky,  colour  of
water in deep sea, the reddening of the sun at
sunrise  and  the  sunset  are  some  of  the
wonderful phenomena we are familiar with. In
the  previous  class,  you  have  learnt  about  the
scattering of light by colloidal particles.   The
path of a beam of light passing through a true
solution  is  not  visible.  However,  its  path
becomes  visible  through  a  colloidal  solution
where  the  size  of  the  particles  is  relatively
larger.

10.6.1 Tyndall Effect

T h e   e a r t h ’ s   a t m o s p h e r e   i s   a
heterogeneous  mixture  of  minute  particles.
These  particles  include  smoke,  tiny  water
droplets,  suspended  particles  of  dust  and
molecules of air. When a beam of light strikes
such  ﬁne  particles,  the  path  of  the  beam
becomes  visible.  The  light  reaches  us,  after
being reﬂected diffusely by these particles. The
phenomenon  of  scattering  of  light  by  the
colloidal particles gives rise to Tyndall effect
which  you  have  studied  in  Class  IX.  This
phenomenon  is  seen  when  a  ﬁne  beam  of
sunlight enters a smoke-ﬁlled room through a
small hole. Thus, scattering of light makes the
particles  visible.  Tyndall  effect  can  also  be
observed  when  sunlight  passes  through  a
canopy  of  a  dense  forest.  Here,  tiny  water
droplets in the mist scatter light.

The colour of the scattered light depends
on the size of the scattering particles. Very ﬁne
particles  scatter  mainly  blue  light  while
particles  of  larger  size  scatter  light  of  longer
wavelengths.  If  the  size  of  the  scattering
particles  is  large  enough,  then,  the  scattered
light may even appear white.

Figure 10.9
Apparent star position due to
atmospheric refraction

  Why don’t the planets twinkle? The planets
are much closer to the earth, and are thus seen as
extended sources. If we consider a planet as a
collection  of  a  large  number  of  point-sized
sources  of  light,  the  total  variation  in  the
amount of light entering our eye from all the
individual point-sized sources will average out
to zero, thereby nullifying the twinkling effect.

Advance sunrise and delayed sunset

The Sun is visible to us about 2 minutes before
the actual sunrise, and about 2 minutes after the
actual  sunset  because  of  atmospheric
refraction.  By  actual  sunrise,  we  mean  the
actual crossing of the horizon by the Sun. Fig.
10.10 shows the actual and apparent positions
of the Sun with respect to the horizon. The time
diﬀerence  between  actual  sunset  and  the
apparent  sunset  is  about  2  minutes.  The
apparent ﬂattening of the Sun’s disc at sunrise
and sunset is also due to the same phenomenon.

10.6  SCATTERING OF LIGHT

The  interplay  of  light  with  objects  around  us

gives rise to several spectacular phenomena in

nature.  The  blue  colour  of  the  sky,  colour  of

water in deep sea, the reddening of the sun at

sunrise  and  the  sunset  are  some  of  the

wonderful phenomena we are familiar with. In

the  previous  class,  you  have  learnt  about  the

scattering of light by colloidal particles.   The

path of a beam of light passing through a true

solution  is  not  visible.  However,  its  path

becomes  visible  through  a  colloidal  solution

where  the  size  of  the  particles  is  relatively

larger.

10.6.1 Tyndall Effect

T h e   e a r t h ’ s   a t m o s p h e r e   i s   a

heterogeneous  mixture  of  minute  particles.

These  particles  include  smoke,  tiny  water

droplets,  suspended  particles  of  dust  and

molecules of air. When a beam of light strikes

such  ﬁne  particles,  the  path  of  the  beam

becomes  visible.  The  light  reaches  us,  after

being reﬂected diffusely by these particles. The

phenomenon  of  scattering  of  light  by  the

colloidal particles gives rise to Tyndall effect

which  you  have  studied  in  Class  IX.  This

phenomenon  is  seen  when  a  ﬁne  beam  of

sunlight enters a smoke-ﬁlled room through a

small hole. Thus, scattering of light makes the

particles  visible.  Tyndall  effect  can  also  be

observed  when  sunlight  passes  through  a

canopy  of  a  dense  forest.  Here,  tiny  water

droplets in the mist scatter light.

The colour of the scattered light depends

on the size of the scattering particles. Very ﬁne

particles  scatter  mainly  blue  light  while

particles  of  larger  size  scatter  light  of  longer

wavelengths.  If  the  size  of  the  scattering

particles  is  large  enough,  then,  the  scattered

light may even appear white.

Figure 10.9

Apparent star position due to

atmospheric refraction

  Why don’t the planets twinkle? The planets

are much closer to the earth, and are thus seen as

extended sources. If we consider a planet as a

collection  of  a  large  number  of  point-sized

sources  of  light,  the  total  variation  in  the

amount of light entering our eye from all the

individual point-sized sources will average out

to zero, thereby nullifying the twinkling effect.

Advance sunrise and delayed sunset

The Sun is visible to us about 2 minutes before

the actual sunrise, and about 2 minutes after the

actual  sunset  because  of  atmospheric

refraction.  By  actual  sunrise,  we  mean  the

actual crossing of the horizon by the Sun. Fig.

10.10 shows the actual and apparent positions

of the Sun with respect to the horizon. The time

diﬀerence  between  actual  sunset  and  the

apparent  sunset  is  about  2  minutes.  The

apparent ﬂattening of the Sun’s disc at sunrise

and sunset is also due to the same phenomenon.

10.6.2 Why is the colour of the clear Sky Blue?

  The molecules of air and other ﬁne particles
in  the  atmosphere  have  size  smaller  than  the
wavelength  of  visible  light.  These  are  more
eﬀective  in  scattering  light  of  shorter
wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer
wavelengths at the red end. The red light has a
wavelength about 1.8 times greater than blue
light. Thus, when sunlight passes through the
atmosphere, the ﬁne particles in air scatter the
blue  colour  (shorter  wavelengths)  more
strongly  than  red.  The  scattered  blue  light

enters our eyes. If the earth had no atmosphere,
there  would  not  have  been  any  scattering.
Then, the sky would have looked dark.   The
sky appears dark to passengers ﬂying at very
high altitudes, as scattering is not prominent at
such heights.

  You  might  have  observed  that  ‘danger’
signal lights are red in colour.   Do you know
why?  The  red  is  least  scattered  by  fog  or
smoke.   Therefore, it can be seen in the same
colour at a distance.

■ The ability of the eye to focus on both near and distant objects, by adjusting its focal

length, is called the accommodation of the eye.

■ The smallest distance, at which the eye can see objects clearly without strain, is called
the near point of the eye or the least distance of distinct vision.  For a young adult with
normal vision, it is about 25 cm.

■ The  common  refractive  defects  of  vision  include  myopia,  hypermetropia  and
presbyopia. Myopia (short-sightedness – the image of distant objects is focussed before
the retina) is corrected by using a concave lens of suitable power. Hypermetropia (far-
sightedness – the image of nearby objects is focussed beyond the retina) is corrected by
using a convex lens of suitable power. The eye loses its power of accommodation at old
age.

■ The splitting of white light into its component colours is called dispersion.
■ Scattering of light causes the blue colour of sky.

 1.  The  human  eye  can  focus  on  objects  at  different  distances  by  adjusting  the  focal

length of the eye lens. This is due to
 (a)  presbyopia.
(c)  near-sightedness.

(b)  accommodation.
(d)  far-sightedness.

■ The ability of the eye to focus on both near and distant objects, by adjusting its focal

■ The  common  refractive  defects  of  vision  include  myopia,  hypermetropia  and

using a convex lens of suitable power. The eye loses its power of accommodation at old

age.

ANDHRA PRADESH | PHYSICAL SCIENCE   : Electricity

lectricity has an important place in modern

Esociety. It is a controllable and convenient

form of energy for a variety of uses in homes,
schools, hospitals, industries and so on. What
constitutes electricity? How does it ﬂow in an
electric  circuit?  What  are  the  factors  that
control  or  regulate  the  current  through  an
electric  circuit?  In  this  Chapter,  we  shall
attempt to answer such questions. We shall also
discuss the heating eﬀect of electric current and
its applications.

11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT

We  are  familiar  with  air  current  and  water
current. We know that ﬂowing water constitute
water current in rivers. Similarly, if the electric
charge ﬂows through a conductor (for example,
through a metallic wire), we say that there is an
electric current in the conductor. In a torch, we
know that the cells (or a battery, when placed in
proper  order)  provide  ﬂow  of  charges  or  an
electric current through the torch bulb to glow.
We have also seen that the torch gives light only
when its switch is on. What does a switch do? A
switch  makes  a  conducting  link  between  the
cell and the bulb. A continuous and closed path
of an electric current is called an electric circuit.
Now, if the circuit is broken anywhere (or the
switch of the torch is turned of f), the current
stops ﬂowing and the bulb does not glow.

How  do  we  express  electric  current?
Electric current is expressed by the amount of
charge ﬂowing through a particular area in unit
time.  In  other  words,  it  is  the  rate  of  ﬂow  of
electric  charges.  In  circuits  using  metallic
wires, electrons constitute the ﬂow of charges.
However, electrons were not known at the time
when the phenomenon of electricity was ﬁrst
observed. So, electric current was considered to
be the ﬂow of positive charges and the direction
of ﬂow of positive charges was taken to be the
direction of electric current. Conventionally, in

240

If  an  opaque  object  on  the  path  of  light

becomes very small, light has a tendency

to bend around it and not walk in a straight

line – an eﬀect known as the diﬀraction of

light. Then the straight-line treatment of

optics  using  rays  fails.  To  explain

phenomena  such  as  diﬀraction,  light  is

thought of as a wave, the details of which

you will study in higher classes. Again, at

the  beginning  of  the  20th  century,  it

became  known  that  the  wave  theory  of

light  often  becomes  inadequate  for

treatment of the interaction of light with

an  electric  circuit  the  direction  of  electric
current is taken as opposite to the direction of
the  ﬂow  of  electrons,  which  are  negative
charges.

If a net charge Q, ﬂows across any cross-
section of a conductor in time t, then the current
I, through the cross-section is

I

=

Q

The SI unit of electric charge is coulomb
(C), which is equivalent to the charge contained
in nearly 6 × 10  electrons. (We know that an
electron possesses a negative charge of 1.6 ×
–1910  C.) The electric current is expressed by a
unit called ampere (A), named after the French
scientist,  Andre-Marie  Ampere  (1775–1836).
One ampere is constituted by the ﬂow of one
coulomb  of  charge  per  second,  that  is,
1 A = 1 C/1 s. Small quantities of current are
expressed in milliampere  (1 µA = 10  A) or in
microampere (1 µA = 10  A). An instrument
called ammeter measures electric current in a
circuit.  It  is  always  connected  in  series  in  a
circuit  through  which  the  current  is  to  be
measured.  Figure  11.1  shows  the  schematic
diagram of a typical electric circuit comprising
a cell, an electric bulb, an ammeter and a plug
key. Note that the electric current ﬂows in the
circuit from the positive terminal of the cell to
the  negative  terminal  of  the  cell  through  the
bulb and ammeter.

ANDHRA PRADESH | PHYSICAL SCIENCE   : Electricity

lectricity has an important place in modern

Esociety. It is a controllable and convenient

form of energy for a variety of uses in homes,

an  electric  circuit  the  direction  of  electric

current is taken as opposite to the direction of

the  ﬂow  of  electrons,  which  are  negative

schools, hospitals, industries and so on. What

charges.

constitutes electricity? How does it ﬂow in an

electric  circuit?  What  are  the  factors  that

control  or  regulate  the  current  through  an

electric  circuit?  In  this  Chapter,  we  shall

attempt to answer such questions. We shall also

discuss the heating eﬀect of electric current and

its applications.

11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT

We  are  familiar  with  air  current  and  water

current. We know that ﬂowing water constitute

water current in rivers. Similarly, if the electric

charge ﬂows through a conductor (for example,

through a metallic wire), we say that there is an

electric current in the conductor. In a torch, we

know that the cells (or a battery, when placed in

proper  order)  provide  ﬂow  of  charges  or  an

electric current through the torch bulb to glow.

We have also seen that the torch gives light only

when its switch is on. What does a switch do? A

switch  makes  a  conducting  link  between  the

cell and the bulb. A continuous and closed path

of an electric current is called an electric circuit.

Now, if the circuit is broken anywhere (or the

switch of the torch is turned of f), the current

stops ﬂowing and the bulb does not glow.

How  do  we  express  electric  current?

Electric current is expressed by the amount of

charge ﬂowing through a particular area in unit

time.  In  other  words,  it  is  the  rate  of  ﬂow  of

electric  charges.  In  circuits  using  metallic

wires, electrons constitute the ﬂow of charges.

However, electrons were not known at the time

when the phenomenon of electricity was ﬁrst

observed. So, electric current was considered to

be the ﬂow of positive charges and the direction

of ﬂow of positive charges was taken to be the

direction of electric current. Conventionally, in

240

If a net charge Q, ﬂows across any cross-

section of a conductor in time t, then the current

I, through the cross-section is

I

=

Q

t

(11.1)

The SI unit of electric charge is coulomb

(C), which is equivalent to the charge contained

in nearly 6 × 10  electrons. (We know that an

18

electron possesses a negative charge of 1.6 ×

–1910  C.) The electric current is expressed by a

unit called ampere (A), named after the French

scientist,  Andre-Marie  Ampere  (1775–1836).

One ampere is constituted by the ﬂow of one

coulomb  of  charge  per  second,  that  is,

1 A = 1 C/1 s. Small quantities of current are

expressed in milliampere  (1 µA = 10  A) or in

–3

microampere (1 µA = 10  A). An instrument

–6

called ammeter measures electric current in a

circuit.  It  is  always  connected  in  series  in  a

circuit  through  which  the  current  is  to  be

measured.  Figure  11.1  shows  the  schematic

diagram of a typical electric circuit comprising

a cell, an electric bulb, an ammeter and a plug

key. Note that the electric current ﬂows in the

circuit from the positive terminal of the cell to

the  negative  terminal  of  the  cell  through  the

bulb and ammeter.

If  an  opaque  object  on  the  path  of  light

becomes very small, light has a tendency

to bend around it and not walk in a straight

line – an eﬀect known as the diﬀraction of

light. Then the straight-line treatment of

optics  using  rays  fails.  To  explain

phenomena  such  as  diﬀraction,  light  is

thought of as a wave, the details of which

you will study in higher classes. Again, at

the  beginning  of  the  20th  century,  it

became  known  that  the  wave  theory  of

light  often  becomes  inadequate  for

treatment of the interaction of light with

11.2  ELECTRIC POTENTIAL AND
POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE

What makes the electric charge to ﬂow? Let us
consider the analogy of ﬂow of water. Charges
do not ﬂow in a copper wire by themselves, just
as water in a perfectly horizontal tube does not
ﬂow. If one end of the tube is connected to a
tank of water kept at a higher level, such that
there is a pressure difference between the two
ends of the tube, water ﬂows out of the other
end  of  the  tube.  For  ﬂow  of  charges  in  a
conducting metallic wire, the gravity, of course,
has no role to play; the electrons move only if
there is a difference of electric pressure – called
the potential difference – along the conductor.
This difference of potential may be produced
by a battery, consisting of one or more electric
cells.  The  chemical  action  within  a  cell
generates  the  potential  difference  across  the

242

terminals of the cell, even when no current is
drawn from it. When the cell is connected to a
conducting  circuit  element,  the  potential
difference  sets  the  charges  in  motion  in  the
conductor and produces an electric current. In
order to maintain the current in a given electric
circuit,  the  cell  has  to  expend  its  chemical
energy stored in it.
  We deﬁne the electric potential difference
between  two  points  in  an  electric  circuit
carrying some current as the work done to move
a unit charge from one point to the other –

Potential  difference  (V)  between  two

points = Work done (W)/Charge (Q)

(11.2)

V =  W/Q
The SI unit of electric potential difference
is  volt  (V),  named  after  Alessandro  Volta
(1745–1827), an Italian physicist. One volt is
the potential difference between two points in a
current  carrying  conductor  when  1  joule  of
work is done to move a charge of 1 coulomb
from one point to the other.

Therefore,

 1 volt =

1 joule
1 coulomb

(11.3)

1 V  = 1 J C

The  potential  difference  is  measured  by
means  of  an  instrument  called  the  voltmeter.
The voltmeter is always connected in parallel
across the points between which the potential
difference is to be measured.
Example 11.2
How much work is done in moving a charge of
2  C  across  two  points  having  a  potential
difference 12 V?
Solution
The  amount  of  charge  Q,  that  ﬂows  between
two points at potential difference V (= 12 V) is 2
C. Thus, the amount of work W, done in moving
the charge [from Eq. (11.2)] is

11.4 OHM’S LAW
Is there a relationship between the potential diﬀerence across a conductor and the current
through it? Let us explore with an Activity.

■ Set  up  a  circuit  as  shown  in  Fig.  11.2,  consisting  of  a
nichrome wire XY of length, say 0.5 m, an ammeter, a
voltmeter and four cells of 1.5 V each. (Nichrome is an
alloy of nickel, chromium, manganese, and iron metals.)
■ First use only one cell as the source in the circuit. Note the
reading in the ammeter I, for the current and reading of the
voltmeter  V  for  the  potential  difference  across  the
nichrome  wire  XY  in  the  circuit.  Tabulate  them  in  the
Table given.

■ Next  connect  two  cells  in  the  circuit  and  note  the
respective readings of the ammeter and voltmeter for the
values of current through the nichrome wire and potential
difference across the nichrome wire.

Figure 11.2 Electric circuit for studying Ohm’s law

■ Repeat the above steps using three cells and then four cells in the circuit separately.
■ Calculate the ratio of V to I for each pair of potential difference V and current I.

Do you know that our eyes can live even

after our death? By donating our eyes after

we  die,  we  can  light  the  life  of  a  blind

person.

About 35 million people in the developing

world are blind and most of them can be

cured.  About  4.5  million  people  with

corneal  blindness  can  be  cured  through

corneal  transplantation  of  donated  eyes.

Out of these 4.5 million, 60% are children

below the age of 12. So, if we have got the

gift  of  vision,  why  not  pass  it  on  to

somebody who does not have it? What do

we have to keep in mind when eyes have to

be donated?

■ Eye donors can belong to any age group

or sex. People who use spectacles, or

those  operated  for  cataract,  can  still

donate  the  eyes.  People  who  are

diabetic,  have  hypertension,  asthma

■ Eye removal takes only 10-15 minutes.

It is a simple process and does not lead

■ Persons who were infected with or died

voltmeter and four cells of 1.5 V each. (Nichrome is an

■ Next  connect  two  cells  in  the  circuit  and  note  the

respective readings of the ammeter and voltmeter for the

values of current through the nichrome wire and potential

difference across the nichrome wire.

■ Repeat the above steps using three cells and then four cells in the circuit separately.

■ Calculate the ratio of V to I for each pair of potential difference V and current I.

In  this  Activity,  you  will  ﬁnd  that
approximately  the  same  value  for  V/I  is
obtained in each case. Thus the V–I graph is a
straight line that passes through the origin of the
graph,  as  shown  in  Fig.  11.3.  Thus,  V/I  is  a
constant ratio.

In Eq. (11.4), R is a constant for the given
metallic  wire  at  a  given  temperature  and  is
called  its  resistance.  It  is  the  property  of  a
conductor to resist the ﬂow of charges  through

If the potential difference across the two
ends  of  a  conductor  is  1  V  and  the  current
through it is 1 A, then the resistance R, of the
conductor is 1 Ω.

 That is, 1 ohm =

1 volt
1 ampere
Also from Eq. (11.5) we get

I = V/R

(11.7)

It  is  obvious  from  Eq.  (11.7)  that  the
current  through  a  resistor  is  inversely
proportional to its resistance. If the resistance is
doubled  the  current  gets  halved.  In  many
practical  cases  it  is  necessary  to  increase  or
decrease  the  current  in  an  electric  circuit.  A
component  used  to  regulate  current  without
changing the voltage source is called variable
resistance. In an electric circuit, a device called
rheostat is often used to change the resistance in
the circuit. We will now study about electrical
resistance  of  a  conductor  with  the  help  of
following Activity.

■ Take a nichrome wire, a torch bulb, a 10

■ Set up the circuit by connecting four dry

ammeter leaving a gap XY in the circuit,
as shown in Fig. 11.4.

The potential difference, V, across the ends of a

directly  proportional  to  the  current  ﬂowing
through it,   provided its temperature remains

In  this  Activity  we  observe  that  the
current  is  different  for  different  components.
Why do they differ? Certain components offer
an  easy  path  for  the  ﬂow  of  electric  current
while the others resist the ﬂow. We know that
motion  of  electrons  in  an  electric  circuit
constitutes  an  electric  current.  The  electrons,
however,  are  not  completely  free  to  move
within a conductor. They are restrained by the
attraction  of  the  atoms  among  which  they
move.  Thus,  motion  of  electrons  through  a
conductor  is  retarded  by  its  resistance.  A
component  of  a  given  size  that  offers  a  low
resistance  is  a  good  conductor.  A  conductor
having some appreciable resistance is called a
resistor.  A  component  of  identical  size  that
offers a higher resistance is a poor conductor.
An insulator of the same size offers even higher
resistance.

factors on which the  resistance of
conducting wires depends

Figure 11.4

■ Complete  the  circuit  by  connecting
the nichrome wire in the gap XY. Plug
the  key.  Note  down  the  ammeter
reading.  Take  out  the  key  from  the
plug. [Note: Always take out the key
from  the  plug  after  measuring  the
current through the circuit.]

■ Replace  the  nichrome  wire  with  the
torch bulb in the circuit and ﬁnd the
current  through  it  by  measuring  the
reading of the ammeter.

■ Now repeat the above step with the 10

W bulb in the gap XY.

■ Are the ammeter readings diﬀerent for
different components connected in the

■ You  may  repeat  this  Activity  by
keeping  any  material  component  in
the  gap.  Observe  the  ammeter
readings  in  each  case.  Analyse  the
observations.

■ Replace the nichrome wire by another
nichrome wire of same thickness but
twice the length, that is 2l [marked (2)
in the Fig. 11.5].

■ Note the ammeter reading.
■ Now  replace  the  wire  by  a  thicker
nichrome  wire,  of  the  same  length  l
[marked  (3)].  A  thicker  wire  has  a
larger cross-sectional area. Again note
down the current through the circuit.
■ Instead  of  taking  a  nichrome  wire,
connect a copper wire [marked (4) in
Fig. 11.5] in the circuit. Let the wire be
of  the  same  length  and  same  area  of
cross-section  as  that  of  the  ﬁrst
nichrome wire [marked (1)]. Note the
value of the current.

■ Notice the difference in the current in

all cases.

■ Does the current depend on the length

of the conductor?

■ Does the current depend on the area of

cross-section of the wire used?

It  is  observed  that  the  ammeter  reading
decreases  to  one-half  when  the  length  of  the
wire  is  doubled.  The  ammeter  reading  is
increased  when  a  thicker  wire  of  the  same
material and of the same length is used in the
circuit.  A  change  in  ammeter  reading  is
observed when a wire of diﬀerent material of
the  same  length  and  the  same  area  of  cross-
section is used. On applying Ohm’s law [Eqs.
(11.5) – (11.7)], we observe that the resistance
of the conductor depends (i) on its length, (ii)
on  its  area  of  cross-section,  and  (iii)  on  the

nature  of  its  material.  Precise  measurements
have  shown  that  resistance  of  a  uniform
metallic conductor is directly proportional to its

Table 11.2 reveals that the resistivity of an
alloy  is  generally  higher  than  that  of  its

they are commonly used in electrical heating
devices,  like  electric  iron,  toasters  etc.
Tungsten  is  used  almost  exclusively  for

Example 11.3

(a)  How much current will an electric bulb
draw from a 220 V source, if the resistance of
the  bulb  ﬁlament  is  1200  Ω?  (b)  How  much
current will an electric heater coil draw from a
220 V source, if the resistance of the heater coil
is 100Ω?

Solution

(a)  We are given V = 220 V; R = 1200 Ω.
From Eq. (11.6), we have the current
I = 220 V/1200 Ω = 0.18 A.

(b)  We are given, V = 220 V, R = 100 Ω.

From Eq. (11.7), we have the current
I = 220 V/100 Ω = 2.2 A.

Note  the  difference  of  current  drawn  by  an
electric bulb and electric heater from the same
220 V source!

Example 11.4

The potential difference between the terminals
of  an  electric  heater  is  60  V  when  it  draws  a
current of 4 A from the source. What current will
the  heater  draw  if  the  potential  difference  is
increased to 120 V?

Solution

We are given, potential difference V =   60 V,
current I = 4 A.

When  the  potential  difference  is  increased  to
120 V the current is given by

current =                            .
= 8 A
=

V
R

120 V
15
Ω

The current through the heater becomes 8 A.

Example 11.5

Resistance of a metal wire of length 1 m is 26 Ω
at 20°C. If the diameter of the wire is 0.3 mm,
what will be the resistivity of the metal at that
temperature?  Using  Table  11.2,  predict  the
material of the wire.

Solution

We are given the resistance R of the wire = 26Ω,
the diameter d = 0.3 mm = 3 × 10  m, and the
length l of the wire = 1 m.

-4

Therefore, from Eq. (11.10), the resistivity of
the given metallic wire is

ρ = (RA/l)  =  (RΠd /4l)

2

Substitution of values in this gives

ρ =  1.84 × 10  Ω m

–6

The resistivity of the metal at 20°C is 1.84 ×
–610  Ω m. From Table 11.2, we see that this is the
resistivity of manganese.

Example 11.6

A  wire  of  given  material  having  length  l  and
area of cross-section A has a resistance of 4 Ω.
What would be the resistance of another wire of
the same material having length l/2 and area of
cross-section 2A?

Solution

For ﬁrst wire

 l
 R              =  4Ω
A

ρ

=

1

Now for second wire

R = 1Ω2

The resistance of the new wire is 1Ω.

1.  On what factors does the resistance of

a conductor depend?

2.  Will current ﬂow more easily through
a thick wire or a thin wire of the same

In preceding sections, we learnt about some
simple electric circuits. We have noticed how
the current through a conductor depends upon
its resistance and the potential difference across
its ends. In various electrical gadgets, we often
use resistors in various combinations. We now
therefore intend to see how Ohm’s law can be
applied to combinations of resistors.

Example 11.5

Resistance of a metal wire of length 1 m is 26 Ω

at 20°C. If the diameter of the wire is 0.3 mm,

what will be the resistivity of the metal at that

temperature?  Using  Table  11.2,  predict  the

material of the wire.

Solution

We are given the resistance R of the wire = 26Ω,

the diameter d = 0.3 mm = 3 × 10  m, and the

-4

length l of the wire = 1 m.

Therefore, from Eq. (11.10), the resistivity of

the given metallic wire is

ρ = (RA/l)  =  (RΠd /4l)

ρ =  1.84 × 10  Ω m

The resistivity of the metal at 20°C is 1.84 ×

–610  Ω m. From Table 11.2, we see that this is the

resistivity of manganese.

Example 11.6

A  wire  of  given  material  having  length  l  and

area of cross-section A has a resistance of 4 Ω.

What would be the resistance of another wire of

the same material having length l/2 and area of

cross-section 2A?

11.6.1 Resistors in Series

What happens to the value of current when a
number of resistors are connected in series in a
circuit?  What  would  be  their  equivalent
resistance? Let us try to understand these with
the help of the following activities.

258

■ Join three resistors of different values
in series. Connect them with a battery,
an ammeter and a plug key, as shown in
Fig. 11.6.  You may use the resistors of
values like 1 Ω, 2 Ω, 3 Ω etc., and a
battery  of  6  V  for  performing  this
Activity.

■ Plug  the  key.  Note  the  ammeter

reading.

■ Change  the  position  of  ammeter  to
anywhere  in  between  the  resistors.
Note the ammeter reading each time.
■ Do you ﬁnd any change in the value of

current through the ammeter?

  You  will  observe  that  the  value  of  the
current in the ammeter is the same, independent
of its position in the electric circuit. It means
that  in  a  series  combination  of  resistors  the
current is the same in every part of the circuit or
the same current through each resistor.

■ In  Activity  11.4,  insert  a  voltmeter
across the ends X and Y of the series
combination  of  three  resistors,  as
shown in Fig. 11.6.

■ Plug the key in the circuit and note the
voltmeter  reading.  It  gives  the
potential  difference  across  the  series
combination of  resistors.  Let it be V.
Now measure the potential difference
across the two terminals of the battery.
Compare the two values.

■ Take out the plug key and disconnect

An electric lamp, whose resistance is 20 Ω, and

In the electric circuit shown in Fig. 11.8, let
I be the current through the circuit. The current

replace the three resistors joined in series by an

Solution

The resistance of electric lamp, R  = 20 Ω,

1

The  resistance  of  the  conductor  connected  in
series, R  = 4 Ω.
2

Then the total resistance in the circuit

R  = R  + R1

2

R   = 20 Ω + 4 Ω = 24 Ω.

s

The  total  potential  difference  across  the  two
terminals of the battery V = 6 V.

Now  by  Ohm’s  law,  the  current  through  the
circuit is given by

I  =    V/Rs

=    6 V/24 Ω

=    0.25 A.

Applying Ohm’s law to the electric lamp and
conductor  separately,  we  get  potential
difference across the electric lamp,

V   =   20 Ω × 0.25 A

1

=    5 V;

and,

                         =  1 V.

Suppose  that  we  like  to  replace  the  series
combination of electric lamp and conductor by
a single and equivalent resistor. Its resistance
must be such that a potential difference of 6 V
across the battery terminals will cause a current
of 0.25 A in the circuit. The resistance R of this
equivalent resistor would be

R  =  V/I

=  6 V/ 0.25 A

=  24 Ω.

putting in an ammeter to measure the
current  through  the  resistors  and  a
voltmeter  to  measure  the  potential
difference  across  the  12  Ω  resistor.
What  would  be  the  readings  in  the

11.6.2 Resistors in Parallel

Now, let us consider the arrangement of three

resistors joined in parallel with a combination

of cells (or a battery), as shown in Fig.11.7.

■ Make  a  parallel  combination,  XY,  of

three resistors having resistances R , R ,

1

2

and R , respectively. Connect it with a

battery, a plug key and an ammeter, as

v o l t m e t e r   i n   p a r a l l e l   w i t h   t h e

Solution

The resistance of electric lamp, R  = 20 Ω,

1

The  resistance  of  the  conductor  connected  in

series, R  = 4 Ω.

2

Then the total resistance in the circuit

R  = R  + R1

2

R   = 20 Ω + 4 Ω = 24 Ω.

s

terminals of the battery V = 6 V.

Now  by  Ohm’s  law,  the  current  through  the

circuit is given by

I  =    V/Rs

=    6 V/24 Ω

=    0.25 A.

V   =   20 Ω × 0.25 A

1

=    5 V;

and,

Applying Ohm’s law to the electric lamp and

conductor  separately,  we  get  potential

difference across the electric lamp,

that across the conductor, V   =  4 Ω × 0.25 A

2

                         =  1 V.

Suppose  that  we  like  to  replace  the  series

combination of electric lamp and conductor by

a single and equivalent resistor. Its resistance

must be such that a potential difference of 6 V

across the battery terminals will cause a current

of 0.25 A in the circuit. The resistance R of this

equivalent resistor would be

R  =  V/I

=  6 V/ 0.25 A

Plug  the  key  and  note  the  ammeter
reading. Let the current be I. Also take
the  voltmeter  reading.  It  gives  the
potential  difference  V,  across  the
combination. The potential difference
across each resistor is also V. This can
be  checked  by  connecting  the
voltmeter  across  each  individual
resistor (see Fig. 11.11).
Take  out  the  plug  from  the  key.
Remove  the  ammeter  and  voltmeter
from the circuit. Insert the ammeter in

Fig. 11.11. Note the ammeter reading,

Let  R   be  the  equivalent  resistance  of  the
parallel combination of resistors. By applying
Ohm’s  law  to  the  parallel  combination  of
resistors, we have

p
I = V/R

264

(11.16)

On  applying  Ohm’s  law  to  each  resistor,  we
have

I  = V /R ;    I  = V /R ; and I  = V /R
3
1

From Eqs. (11.15) to (11.17), we have

     (11.17)

V/R  = V/R  + V/R  + V/R

  Thus, we may conclude that the reciprocal
of  the  equivalent  resistance  of  a  group  of
resistances joined in parallel is equal to the sum
of the reciprocals of the individual resistances.

have  been  connected  to  a  battery  of  12  V.
Calculate (a) the current through each resistor,
(b) the total current in the circuit, and (c) the
total circuit resistance.

Potential difference across the battery,

This is also the potential difference across each

Plug  the  key  and  note  the  ammeter

reading. Let the current be I. Also take

the  voltmeter  reading.  It  gives  the

potential  difference  V,  across  the

combination. The potential difference

across each resistor is also V. This can

be  checked  by  connecting  the

voltmeter  across  each  individual

resistor (see Fig. 11.11).

■

Take  out  the  plug  from  the  key.

Remove  the  ammeter  and  voltmeter

from the circuit. Insert the ammeter in

  Thus, we may conclude that the reciprocal

of  the  equivalent  resistance  of  a  group  of

resistances joined in parallel is equal to the sum

of the reciprocals of the individual resistances.

In  the  circuit  diagram  given  in  Fig.  11.10,

suppose  the  resistors  R ,  R   and  R   have  the

have  been  connected  to  a  battery  of  12  V.

Calculate (a) the current through each resistor,

(b) the total current in the circuit, and (c) the

Potential difference across the battery,

V = 12 V.

This is also the potential difference across each

of the individual resistor; therefore, to calculate

the current in the resistors, we use Ohm’s law.

It is observed that the total current I, is equal

to the sum of the separate currents through each

branch of the combination.

Suppose we replace the parallel resistors R  1
and R  by an equivalent resistor of resistance,
IR .  Similarly  we  replace  the  parallel  resistors
R , R  and R  by an equivalent single resistor of
resistance R . Then using Eq. (11.18), we have

I

1/ R  = 1/10 + 1/40 = 5/40;  that is  R   = 8 Ω.

I

Similarly,

II

1/ R  =1/30 + 1/20 + 1/60 = 6/60;

          that is, R   = 10 Ω.

   e\jáT+ýË yîTTÔáï+ $<ŠT«ÔY ç|ŸyVŸ²eTT,

II

 nq>± R   = 10 Ω

Thus, the total resistance, R = R  + R  = 18 Ω.

I

To calculate the current, we use Ohm’s law, and
get

 I = V/R = 12 V/18 Ω = 0.67 A.

  We  have  seen  that  in  a  series  circuit  the
current  is  constant  throughout  the  electric
circuit.  Thus  it  is  obviously  impracticable  to
connect an electric bulb and an electric heater in
series,  because  they  need  currents  of  widely
different  values  to  operate  properly  (see
Example 11.3). Another major disadvantage of
a series circuit is that when one component fails
the  circuit  is  broken  and  none  of  the
components  works.  If  you  have  used  ‘fairy
lights’  to  decorate  buildings  on  festivals,  on
marriage celebrations etc., you might have seen
the electrician spending lot of time in trouble-
locating and replacing the ‘dead’ bulb – each
has to be tested to ﬁnd which has fused or gone.
On the other hand, a parallel circuit divides the
current through the electrical gadgets. The total
resistance in a parallel circuit is decreased as
per  Eq.  (11.18).  This  is  helpful  particularly
when each gadget has different resistance and
requires different current to operate properly.

1.  Judge the equivalent resistance when
the following are connected in parallel
– (a) 1 Ω and 10  Ω, (b) 1 Ω and 10  Ω,
and 10  Ω.

R , R  and R  by an equivalent single resistor of

An electric circuit showing

the combination of series and parallel resistors

  We  have  seen  that  in  a  series  circuit  the

current  is  constant  throughout  the  electric

circuit.  Thus  it  is  obviously  impracticable  to

connect an electric bulb and an electric heater in

series,  because  they  need  currents  of  widely

different  values  to  operate  properly  (see

Example 11.3). Another major disadvantage of

a series circuit is that when one component fails

the  circuit  is  broken  and  none  of  the

components  works.  If  you  have  used  ‘fairy

lights’  to  decorate  buildings  on  festivals,  on

marriage celebrations etc., you might have seen

the electrician spending lot of time in trouble-

locating and replacing the ‘dead’ bulb – each

has to be tested to ﬁnd which has fused or gone.

On the other hand, a parallel circuit divides the

current through the electrical gadgets. The total

resistance in a parallel circuit is decreased as

per  Eq.  (11.18).  This  is  helpful  particularly

when each gadget has different resistance and

requires different current to operate properly.

1.  Judge the equivalent resistance when

the following are connected in parallel

– (a) 1 Ω and 10  Ω, (b) 1 Ω and 10  Ω,

3

and 10  Ω.

11.7  HEATING  EFFECT  OF  ELECTRIC
CURRENT

We know that a battery or a cell is a source of
electrical energy. The chemical reaction within
the  cell  generates  the  potential  difference
between its two terminals that sets the electrons
in motion to ﬂow the current through a resistor
or a system of resistors connected to the battery.
We  have  also  seen,  in  Section  11.2,  that  to
maintain  the  current,  the  source  has  to  keep
expending its energy. Where does this energy
go? A part of the source energy in maintaining
the current may be consumed into useful work
(like in rotating the blades of an electric fan).
Rest of the source energy may be expended in
heat  to  raise  the  temperature  of  gadget.  We
often  observe  this  in  our  everyday  life.  For
example, an electric fan becomes warm if used
continuously for longer time etc. On the other
hand, if the electric circuit is purely resistive,
that  is,  a  conﬁguration  of  resistors  only
connected  to  a  battery;  the  source  energy
continually gets dissipated entirely in the form
of heat. This is known as the heating eﬀect of
electric current. This effect is utilised in devices
such as electric heater, electric iron etc.

268

  Consider  a  current  I  ﬂowing  through  a
resistor  of  resistance  R.  Let  the  potential
difference across it be V (Fig. 11.13). Let t be
the time during which a charge Q ﬂows across.
The work done in moving the charge Q through
a potential difference V is VQ. Therefore, the
source must supply energy equal to VQ in time
t. Hence the power input to the circuit by the
source is

=
P V

=

VI

(11.19)

Q
t

  Or the energy supplied to the circuit by the
source  in  time  t  is  P  ×  t,  that  is,  VIt.  What
happens  to  this  energy  expended  by  the
source?  This  energy  gets  dissipated  in  the
r e s i s t o r   a s   h e a t .   T h u s   f o r   a   s t e a d y
current  I,  the  amount  of  heat  H  produced  in
time t is

  H = VIt

(11.20)

Applying Ohm’s law [Eq. (11.5)], we get

  H = I  Rt

2

(11.21)

  This  is  known  as  Joule’s  law  of  heating.
The law implies that heat produced in a resistor
is  (i)  directly  proportional  to  the  square  of
current  for  a  given  resistance,  (ii)  directly
proportional to resistance for a given current,
and (iii) directly proportional to the time for
which the current ﬂows through the resistor. In
practical situations, when an electric appliance
is  connected  to  a  known  voltage  source,  Eq.
(11.21)  is  used  after  calculating  the  current
through it, using the relation I = V/R.

  Consider  a  current  I  ﬂowing  through  a

resistor  of  resistance  R.  Let  the  potential

difference across it be V (Fig. 11.13). Let t be

the time during which a charge Q ﬂows across.

The work done in moving the charge Q through

a potential difference V is VQ. Therefore, the

source must supply energy equal to VQ in time

t. Hence the power input to the circuit by the

source is

P V

=

Q

t

  Or the energy supplied to the circuit by the

source  in  time  t  is  P  ×  t,  that  is,  VIt.  What

happens  to  this  energy  expended  by  the

source?  This  energy  gets  dissipated  in  the

r e s i s t o r   a s   h e a t .   T h u s   f o r   a   s t e a d y

current  I,  the  amount  of  heat  H  produced  in

time t is

  H = VIt

  H = I  Rt

Applying Ohm’s law [Eq. (11.5)], we get

  This  is  known  as  Joule’s  law  of  heating.

The law implies that heat produced in a resistor

is  (i)  directly  proportional  to  the  square  of

current  for  a  given  resistance,  (ii)  directly

proportional to resistance for a given current,

and (iii) directly proportional to the time for

which the current ﬂows through the resistor. In

practical situations, when an electric appliance

is  connected  to  a  known  voltage  source,  Eq.

(11.21)  is  used  after  calculating  the  current

through it, using the relation I = V/R.

11.7  HEATING  EFFECT  OF  ELECTRIC

CURRENT

We know that a battery or a cell is a source of

electrical energy. The chemical reaction within

the  cell  generates  the  potential  difference

between its two terminals that sets the electrons

in motion to ﬂow the current through a resistor

or a system of resistors connected to the battery.

We  have  also  seen,  in  Section  11.2,  that  to

maintain  the  current,  the  source  has  to  keep

expending its energy. Where does this energy

go? A part of the source energy in maintaining

the current may be consumed into useful work

(like in rotating the blades of an electric fan).

Rest of the source energy may be expended in

heat  to  raise  the  temperature  of  gadget.  We

often  observe  this  in  our  everyday  life.  For

example, an electric fan becomes warm if used

continuously for longer time etc. On the other

hand, if the electric circuit is purely resistive,

that  is,  a  conﬁguration  of  resistors  only

connected  to  a  battery;  the  source  energy

continually gets dissipated entirely in the form

of heat. This is known as the heating eﬀect of

electric current. This effect is utilised in devices

such as electric heater, electric iron etc.

Example 11.10

An electric iron consumes energy at a rate of
840 W when heating is at the maximum rate and
360 W when the heating is at the minimum. The
voltage is 220 V. What are the current and the
resistance in each case?

Solution

From Eq. (11.19), we know that the power input
is  P = V I

Thus the current  I = P/V

(a)    When heating is at the maximum rate,

          I = 840 W/220 V = 3.82 A;

and the resistance of the electric iron is

          R = V/I = 220 V/3.82 A = 57.60 Ω.

(b)  When heating is at the minimum rate,

           I = 360 W/220 V = 1.64 A;

and the resistance of the electric iron is

R = V/I = 220 V/1.64 A = 134.15Ω.

Example 11.11

100 J of heat is produced each second in a 4 Ω
resistance. Find the potential difference across
the resistor.

Solution

H = 100 J, R = 4 Ω, t = 1 s, V = ?

From Eq. (11.21) we have the current through
the resistor as

I   =

√(H/Rt)

=

=

√[100 J/(4 Ω ×1 s)]

5 A

Thus the potential difference across the resistor,
V [from Eq. (11.5)] is

270

V  =

IR

=

=

5 A × 4 Ω

20 V.

11.7.1  Practical  Applications  of  Heating
Effect of Electric Current

  The generation of heat in a conductor is an
inevitable  consequence  of  electric  current.  In
many  cases,  it  is  undesirable  as  it  converts
useful  electrical  energy  into  heat.  In  electric
circuits, the unavoidable heating can increase
the  temperature  of  the  components  and  alter
their  properties.  However,  heating  effect  of
electric current has many useful applications.
The  electric  laundry  iron,  electric  toaster,
electric oven, electric kettle and electric heater
are  some  of  the  familiar  devices  based  on
Joule’s heating.

  The electric heating is also used to produce
light, as in an electric bulb. Here, the ﬁlament
must retain as much of the heat generated as is
possible, so that it gets very hot and emits light.
It  must  not  melt  at  such  high  temperature. A
strong  metal  with  high  melting  point  such  as
tungsten  (melting  point  3380°C)  is  used  for
making bulb ﬁlaments. The ﬁlament should be
thermally isolated as much as possible, using
insulating  support,  etc. The  bulbs  are  usually

Example 11.10

An electric iron consumes energy at a rate of

840 W when heating is at the maximum rate and

360 W when the heating is at the minimum. The

voltage is 220 V. What are the current and the

resistance in each case?

From Eq. (11.19), we know that the power input

is  P = V I

Thus the current  I = P/V

(a)    When heating is at the maximum rate,

          I = 840 W/220 V = 3.82 A;

and the resistance of the electric iron is

          R = V/I = 220 V/3.82 A = 57.60 Ω.

and the resistance of the electric iron is

R = V/I = 220 V/1.64 A = 134.15Ω.

100 J of heat is produced each second in a 4 Ω

resistance. Find the potential difference across

Example 11.11

the resistor.

Solution

H = 100 J, R = 4 Ω, t = 1 s, V = ?

From Eq. (11.21) we have the current through

the resistor as

I   =

√(H/Rt)

√[100 J/(4 Ω ×1 s)]

=

=

5 A

Thus the potential difference across the resistor,

V [from Eq. (11.5)] is

V  =

IR

=

=

5 A × 4 Ω

11.7.1  Practical  Applications  of  Heating

Effect of Electric Current

  The generation of heat in a conductor is an

inevitable  consequence  of  electric  current.  In

many  cases,  it  is  undesirable  as  it  converts

useful  electrical  energy  into  heat.  In  electric

circuits, the unavoidable heating can increase

the  temperature  of  the  components  and  alter

their  properties.  However,  heating  effect  of

electric current has many useful applications.

The  electric  laundry  iron,  electric  toaster,

electric oven, electric kettle and electric heater

are  some  of  the  familiar  devices  based  on

Joule’s heating.

  The electric heating is also used to produce

light, as in an electric bulb. Here, the ﬁlament

must retain as much of the heat generated as is

possible, so that it gets very hot and emits light.

It  must  not  melt  at  such  high  temperature. A

strong  metal  with  high  melting  point  such  as

tungsten  (melting  point  3380°C)  is  used  for

making bulb ﬁlaments. The ﬁlament should be

thermally isolated as much as possible, using

insulating  support,  etc. The  bulbs  are  usually

ﬁlled  with  chemically  inactive  nitrogen  and
argon gases to prolong the life of ﬁlament. Most
of the power consumed by the ﬁlament appears
as heat, but a small part of it is in the form of
light radiated.

  Another  common  application  of  Joule’s
heating is the fuse used in electric circuits. It
protects circuits and appliances by stopping the
ﬂow of any unduly high electric current. The
fuse  is  placed  in  series  with  the  device.  It
consists of a piece of wire made of a metal or an
alloy of appropriate melting point, for example
aluminium, copper, iron, lead etc. If a current
larger than the speciﬁed value ﬂows through the
circuit,  the  temperature  of  the  fuse  wire
increases. This melts the fuse wire and breaks
the circuit. The fuse wire is usually encased in a
cartridge of porcelain or similar material with
metal  ends.  The  fuses  used  for  domestic
purposes are rated as 1 A, 2 A, 3 A, 5 A, 10 A,
etc. For an electric iron which consumes 1 kW
electric  power  when  operated  at  220  V,  a
current of (1000/220) A, that is, 4.54 A will ﬂow
in the circuit. In this case, a 5 A fuse must be
used.

11.8 ELECTRIC POWER

  You have studied in your earlier Class that
the rate of doing work is power. This is also the
rate of consumption of energy.

  Equation  (11.21)  gives  the  rate  at  which
electric energy is dissipated or consumed in an
electric circuit. This is also termed as electric
power. The power P is given by

  P  =  VI

Or

P  =  I R = V /R

2

(11.22)

The SI unit of electric power is watt (W). It is
the power consumed by a device that carries 1 A
of  current  when  operated  at  a  potential
difference of 1 V. Thus,

272

   1 W  =  1 volt × 1 ampere = 1 V A       (11.23)

  The unit ‘watt’ is very small. Therefore, in
actual practice we use a much larger unit called
‘kilowatt’.  It  is  equal  to  1000  watts.  Since
electrical  energy  is  the  product  of  power  and
time,  the  unit  of  electric  energy  is,  therefore,
watt hour (W h). One watt hour is the energy
consumed when 1 watt of power is used for 1
hour. The commercial unit of electric energy is
kilowatt  hour  (kW  h),  commonly  known  as
‘unit’.

1 kW h  =

1000 watt × 3600 second

=

=

3.6 × 10  watt second

6

6
3.6 × 10  joule (J)

Many  people  think  that  electrons  are
consumed  in  an  electric  circuit.  This  is
wrong!  We  pay  the  electricity  board  or
electric  company  to  provide  energy  to
move  electrons  through  the  electric
gadgets  like  electric  bulb,  fan  and
engines. We  pay  for  the  energy  that  we
use.

Example 11.12
An  electric  bulb  is  connected  to  a  220  V
generator. The  current  is  0.50 A. What  is  the
power of the bulb?

Solution

P  =

VI

=

=

=

220 V× 0.50 A

110 J/s

110 W.

Example 11.13
An electric refrigerator rated 400 W operates 8
hour/day.  What  is  the  cost  of  the  energy  to
operate it for 30 days at Rs 3.00 per kW h?

The SI unit of electric power is watt (W). It is

the power consumed by a device that carries 1 A

of  current  when  operated  at  a  potential

difference of 1 V. Thus,

Many  people  think  that  electrons  are

consumed  in  an  electric  circuit.  This  is

wrong!  We  pay  the  electricity  board  or

electric  company  to  provide  energy  to

move  electrons  through  the  electric

gadgets  like  electric  bulb,  fan  and

engines. We  pay  for  the  energy  that  we

An  electric  bulb  is  connected  to  a  220  V

generator. The  current  is  0.50 A. What  is  the

Solution

The total energy consumed by the refrigerator
in 30 days would be

400 W × 8.0 hour/day × 30 days = 96000 W h

    = 96 kW h

Thus  the  cost  of  energy  to  operate  the
refrigerator for 30 days is

96 kW h ×  Rs 3.00 per kW h = Rs 288.00

energy is delivered by a current?

2.  An electric motor takes 5 A from a 220 V
line. Determine the power of the motor
and the energy consumed in 2 h.

n  the  previous  Chapter  on  ‘Electricity’  we

Ilearnt  about  the  heating  effects  of  electric

current.  What  could  be  the  other  effects  of
electric  current?  We  know  that  an  electric
current-carrying  wire  behaves  like  a  magnet.
Let  us  perform  the  following  Activity  to
reinforce it.

Figure 10.1 The human eye

If  an  opaque  object  on  the  path  of  light

becomes very small, light has a tendency

to bend around it and not walk in a straight

line – an eﬀect known as the diﬀraction of

light. Then the straight-line treatment of

optics  using  rays  fails.  To  explain

phenomena  such  as  diﬀraction,  light  is

thought of as a wave, the details of which

you will study in higher classes. Again, at

the  beginning  of  the  20th  century,  it

became  known  that  the  wave  theory  of

light  often  becomes  inadequate  for

treatment of the interaction of light with

Resistor

Long straight conductor

Figure 12.1
Compass needle is deﬂected on passing an
electric current through a metallic conductor

■ Take  a  straight  thick  copper  wire  and
place it between the points X and Y in
an  electric  circuit,  as  shown  in  Fig.
12.1. The wire XY is kept perpendicular
to the plane of paper.

■ Horizontally  place  a  small  compass
near  to  this  copper  wire.  See  the
position of its needle.

■ Pass the current through the circuit by

inserting the key into the plug.

■ Observe the change in the position of

the compass needle.

  We see that the needle is deﬂected. What
does it mean?  It means that the electric current
through  the  copper  wire  has  produced  a
magnetic  eﬀect.  Thus  we  can  say  that

282

electricity  and  magnetism  are  linked  to  each
other. Then, what about the reverse possibility
of an electric effect of moving magnets? In this
Chapter we will study magnetic ﬁelds and such
electromagnetic  effects.  We  shall  also  study
about  electromagnets  which  involve  the
magnetic effect of electric current.

Hans  Christian  Oersted,
o n e   o f   t h e   l e a d i n g
scientists  of  the  19th
century,  played  a  crucial
role  in  understanding
electromagnetism. In 1820
he accidentally discovered
that a compass needle got deﬂected when
an  electric  current  passed  through  a
metallic wire placed nearby. Through this
o b s e r v a t i o n   O e r s t e d   s h o w e d   t h a t
electricity  and  magnetism  were  related
phenomena.  His  research  later  created
technologies such as the radio, television
and ﬁber optics. The unit of magnetic ﬁeld
strength is named the oersted in his honor.

12.1  MAGNETIC  FIELD  AND  FIELD
LINES
  We  are  familiar  with  the  fact  that  a
compass  needle  gets  deﬂected  when  brought
near a bar magnet. A compass needle is, in fact,
a small bar magnet. The ends of the compass
needle point approximately towards north and
south  directions.  The  end  pointing  towards
north is called north seeking or north pole. The
other  end  that  points  towards  south  is  called
south seeking or south pole. Through various
activities  we  have  observed  that  like  poles
repel,  while  unlike  poles  of  magnets  attract
each other.

■ Take  a  straight  thick  copper  wire  and

place it between the points X and Y in

an  electric  circuit,  as  shown  in  Fig.

to the plane of paper.

■ Horizontally  place  a  small  compass

near  to  this  copper  wire.  See  the

position of its needle.

■ Pass the current through the circuit by

inserting the key into the plug.

■ Observe the change in the position of

the compass needle.

  We see that the needle is deﬂected. What

does it mean?  It means that the electric current

through  the  copper  wire  has  produced  a

magnetic  eﬀect.  Thus  we  can  say  that

Hans  Christian  Oersted,

o n e   o f   t h e   l e a d i n g

scientists  of  the  19th

century,  played  a  crucial

role  in  understanding

electromagnetism. In 1820

he accidentally discovered

that a compass needle got deﬂected when

an  electric  current  passed  through  a

metallic wire placed nearby. Through this

o b s e r v a t i o n   O e r s t e d   s h o w e d   t h a t

electricity  and  magnetism  were  related

phenomena.  His  research  later  created

technologies such as the radio, television

and ﬁber optics. The unit of magnetic ﬁeld

LINES

  We  are  familiar  with  the  fact  that  a

compass  needle  gets  deﬂected  when  brought

near a bar magnet. A compass needle is, in fact,

a small bar magnet. The ends of the compass

needle point approximately towards north and

south  directions.  The  end  pointing  towards

north is called north seeking or north pole. The

other  end  that  points  towards  south  is  called

south seeking or south pole. Through various

activities  we  have  observed  that  like  poles

repel,  while  unlike  poles  of  magnets  attract

each other.

If  an  opaque  object  on  the  path  of  light

becomes very small, light has a tendency

to bend around it and not walk in a straight

line – an eﬀect known as the diﬀraction of

light. Then the straight-line treatment of

optics  using  rays  fails.  To  explain

phenomena  such  as  diﬀraction,  light  is

thought of as a wave, the details of which

you will study in higher classes. Again, at

the  beginning  of  the  20th  century,  it

became  known  that  the  wave  theory  of

light  often  becomes  inadequate  for

treatment of the interaction of light with

■ Mark the boundary of the magnet.
■ Place the compass near the north pole

The  north  pole  of  the  compass  is

■ Join the points marked on the paper by
a smooth curve.  This curve represents
a ﬁeld line.

■ Repeat the above procedure and draw
as many lines as you can. You will get a
pattern shown in Fig. 12.4. These lines
represent the magnetic ﬁeld around the
magnet. These are known as magnetic
ﬁeld lines.

Figure 12.4
Field lines around a bar magnet

■ Observe the deﬂection in the compass
needle as you move it along a ﬁeld line.
The deﬂection increases as the needle is
moved towards the poles.

Magnetic ﬁeld is a quantity that has both
direction and magnitude.   The direction of the
magnetic  ﬁeld  is  taken  to  be  the  direction  in
which  a  north  pole  of  the  compass  needle
moves  inside  it.    Therefore  it  is  taken  by
convention  that  the  ﬁeld  lines  emerge  from
north pole and merge at the south pole (note the
arrows marked on the ﬁeld lines in Fig. 12.4).

286

Inside the magnet, the direction of ﬁeld lines is
from its south pole to its north pole. Thus the
magnetic ﬁeld lines are closed curves.

The relative strength of the magnetic ﬁeld
is shown by the degree of closeness of the ﬁeld
lines.  The  ﬁeld  is  stronger,  that  is,  the  force
acting on the pole of another magnet placed is
greater where the ﬁeld lines are crowded (see
Fig. 12.4).

No two ﬁeld-lines are found to cross each
other. If they did, it would mean that at the point
of intersection, the compass needle would point
towards two directions, which is not possible.

12.2  MAGNETIC  FIELD  DUE  TO  A
CURRENT-CARRYING CONDUCTOR
In Activity 12.1, we have seen that an electric
current through a metallic conductor produces
a magnetic ﬁeld around it. In order to ﬁnd the
direction of the ﬁeld produced let us repeat the
activity in the following way –

(a)

(b)

Figure 12.5  A simple electric circuit in which a straight
copper wire is placed parallel to and over a compass
needle.
The deﬂection in the needle becomes opposite when the
direction of the current is reversed.

■ Take a long straight copper wire, two or
three cells of 1.5 V each, and a plug key.
Connect all of them in series as shown
in Fig. 12.5 (a).

■ Place  the  straight  wire  parallel  to  and

over a compass needle.
■ Plug the key in the circuit.
■ Observe  the  direction  of  deﬂection  of
the  north  pole  of  the  needle.  If  the
current  ﬂows  from  north  to  south,  as
shown in Fig. 12.5 (a), the north pole of
the  compass  needle  would  move
towards the east.

■ Replace  the  cell  connections  in  the
circuit as shown in Fig. 12.5 (b). This
would  result  in  the  change  of  the
direction of current through the copper
wire, that is, from south to north.

■ Observe the change in the direction of
deﬂection  of  the  needle. You  will  see
that now the needle moves in opposite
direction, that is, towards the west [Fig.
12.5 (b)]. It means that the direction of
magnetic ﬁeld produced by the electric
current is also reversed.

12.2.1 Magnetic  Field  due  to  a  Current
through a Straight Conductor

What  determines  the  pattern  of  the  magnetic
ﬁeld  generated  by  a  current  through  a
conductor?  Does  the  pattern  depend  on  the
shape  of  the  conductor?  We  shall  investigate
this with an activity.
  We  shall  ﬁrst  consider  the  pattern  of  the
magnetic  ﬁeld  around  a  straight  conductor
carrying current.

■ Take  a  battery  (12  V),  a  variable
resistance (or a rheostat), an ammeter
(0–5 A), a plug key, connecting wires
and a long straight thick copper wire.
■ Insert  the  thick  wire  through  the
centre,  normal  to  the  plane  of  a
rectangular cardboard.  Take care that
the  cardboard  is  ﬁxed  and  does  not
slide up or down.

■ Connect  the  copper  wire  vertically
between the points X and Y, as shown
in  Fig.  12.6  (a),  in  series  with  the
battery, a plug and key.

■ Sprinkle some iron ﬁlings uniformly
on the cardboard. (You may use a salt
sprinkler for this purpose.)

■ Keep the variable of the rheostat at a
ﬁxed  position  and  note  the  current
through the ammeter.

■ Take a long straight copper wire, two or

three cells of 1.5 V each, and a plug key.

Connect all of them in series as shown

in Fig. 12.5 (a).

■ Place  the  straight  wire  parallel  to  and

over a compass needle.

■ Plug the key in the circuit.

■ Observe  the  direction  of  deﬂection  of

the  north  pole  of  the  needle.  If  the

current  ﬂows  from  north  to  south,  as

shown in Fig. 12.5 (a), the north pole of

the  compass  needle  would  move

towards the east.

■ Replace  the  cell  connections  in  the

circuit as shown in Fig. 12.5 (b). This

would  result  in  the  change  of  the

direction of current through the copper

wire, that is, from south to north.

■ Observe the change in the direction of

deﬂection  of  the  needle. You  will  see

that now the needle moves in opposite

direction, that is, towards the west [Fig.

12.5 (b)]. It means that the direction of

magnetic ﬁeld produced by the electric

current is also reversed.

12.2.1 Magnetic  Field  due  to  a  Current

through a Straight Conductor

What  determines  the  pattern  of  the  magnetic

ﬁeld  generated  by  a  current  through  a

conductor?  Does  the  pattern  depend  on  the

shape  of  the  conductor?  We  shall  investigate

this with an activity.

  We  shall  ﬁrst  consider  the  pattern  of  the

magnetic  ﬁeld  around  a  straight  conductor

carrying current.

(a) A pattern of concentric circles indicating the

ﬁeld lines of a magnetic ﬁeld around a straight

conducting wire. The arrows in the circles show the

direction of the ﬁeld lines.

(b) A close up of the pattern obtained.

■ Take  a  battery  (12  V),  a  variable

resistance (or a rheostat), an ammeter

(0–5 A), a plug key, connecting wires

and a long straight thick copper wire.

■ Insert  the  thick  wire  through  the

centre,  normal  to  the  plane  of  a

rectangular cardboard.  Take care that

the  cardboard  is  ﬁxed  and  does  not

slide up or down.

■ Connect  the  copper  wire  vertically

between the points X and Y, as shown

in  Fig.  12.6  (a),  in  series  with  the

battery, a plug and key.

■ Sprinkle some iron ﬁlings uniformly

on the cardboard. (You may use a salt

sprinkler for this purpose.)

■ Keep the variable of the rheostat at a

ﬁxed  position  and  note  the  current

through the ammeter.

■ Close  the  key  so  that  a  current  ﬂows
through  the  wire.  Ensure  that  the
copper wire placed between the points
X and Y remains vertically straight.
■ Gently tap the cardboard a few times.
Observe the pattern of the iron ﬁlings.
You  would  ﬁnd  that  the  iron  ﬁlings
align themselves showing a pattern of
concentric  circles  around  the  copper
wire (Fig. 12.6).

■ What  do  these  concentric  circles
represent? They represent the magnetic
ﬁeld lines.

■ How can the direction of the magnetic
ﬁeld  be  found?  Place  a  compass  at  a
point (say P) over a circle. Observe the
direction of the needle. The direction of
the  north  pole  of  the  compass  needle
would  give  the  direction  of  the  ﬁeld
lines  produced  by  the  electric  current
through  the  straight  wire  at  point  P.
Show the direction by an arrow.

■ Does  the  direction  of  magnetic  ﬁeld
lines  get  reversed  if  the  direction  of
current  through  the  straight  copper
wire is reversed? Check it.

  What  happens  to  the  deﬂection  of  the
compass needle placed at a given point if the
current in the copper wire is changed? To see
this, vary the current in the wire. We ﬁnd that
the  deﬂection  in  the  needle  also  changes.  In
fact, if the current is increased, the deﬂection
also increases. It indicates that the magnitude of
the  magnetic  ﬁeld  produced  at  a  given  point
increases  as  the  current  through  the  wire
increases.
  What  happens  to  the  deﬂection  of  the
needle if the compass is moved  away from the
copper  wire  but  the  current  through  the  wire

290

remains the same? To see this, now place the
compass at a farther point from the conducting
wire  (say  at  point  Q).  What  change  do  you
observe?  We  see  that  the  deﬂection  in  the
needle  decreases.  Thus  the  magnetic  ﬁeld
produced by a given current in the conductor
decreases  as  the  distance  from  it  increases.
From  Fig.  12.6,  it  can  be  noticed  that  the
concentric  circles  representing  the  magnetic
ﬁeld  around  a  current-carrying  straight  wire
become  larger  and  larger  as  we  move  away
from it.
12.2.2 Right-Hand Thumb Rule
A  convenient  way  of  ﬁnding  the  direction  of
magnetic  ﬁeld  associated  with  a  current-
carrying conductor is given in Fig. 12.7.

Figure 12.7
Right-hand thumb rule

Imagine  that  you  are  holding  a  current-
carrying straight conductor in your right hand
such  that  the  thumb  points  towards  the
direction  of  current.  Then  your  ﬁngers  will
wrap around the conductor in the direction of
the ﬁeld lines of the magnetic ﬁeld, as shown in
Fig.  12.7.  This  is  known  as  the  right-hand
thumb rule*.
Example 12.1
A current through a horizontal power line ﬂows
in east to west direction. What is the direction of
magnetic ﬁeld at a point directly below it and at
a point directly above it?
Solution
The  current  is  in  the  east-west  direction.
Applying the right-hand thumb rule, we get that

point (say P) over a circle. Observe the

direction of the needle. The direction of

the  north  pole  of  the  compass  needle

would  give  the  direction  of  the  ﬁeld

lines  produced  by  the  electric  current

through  the  straight  wire  at  point  P.

Show the direction by an arrow.

■ Does  the  direction  of  magnetic  ﬁeld

lines  get  reversed  if  the  direction  of

current  through  the  straight  copper

wire is reversed? Check it.

  What  happens  to  the  deﬂection  of  the

compass needle placed at a given point if the

current in the copper wire is changed? To see

this, vary the current in the wire. We ﬁnd that

the  deﬂection  in  the  needle  also  changes.  In

fact, if the current is increased, the deﬂection

also increases. It indicates that the magnitude of

the  magnetic  ﬁeld  produced  at  a  given  point

increases  as  the  current  through  the  wire

increases.

copper  wire  but  the  current  through  the  wire

Right-hand thumb rule

Imagine  that  you  are  holding  a  current-

carrying straight conductor in your right hand

such  that  the  thumb  points  towards  the

direction  of  current.  Then  your  ﬁngers  will

wrap around the conductor in the direction of

the ﬁeld lines of the magnetic ﬁeld, as shown in

Fig.  12.7.  This  is  known  as  the  right-hand

thumb rule*.

Example 12.1

A current through a horizontal power line ﬂows

in east to west direction. What is the direction of

magnetic ﬁeld at a point directly below it and at

a point directly above it?

Solution

The  current  is  in  the  east-west  direction.

Applying the right-hand thumb rule, we get that

the magnetic ﬁeld (at any point below or above

1.  Draw  magnetic  ﬁeld  lines  around  a

2.  List  the  properties  of  magnetic  ﬁeld

3.  Why  don’t  two  magnetic  ﬁeld  lines

intersect each other?

?

12.2.3 Magnetic Field due to a Current
through a Circular Loop

We have so far observed the pattern of
the  magnetic  ﬁeld  lines  produced  around  a
current-carrying  straight  wire.  Suppose  this
straight wire is bent in the form of a circular
loop  and  a  current  is  passed  through  it.  How
would  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  lines  look  like? We
know  that  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  produced  by  a
current-carrying  straight  wire  depends
inversely on the distance from it. Similarly at
every point of a current-carrying circular loop,
the  concentric  circles  representing  the
magnetic ﬁeld around it would become larger
and larger as we move away from the wire (Fig.
12.8). By the time we reach at the centre of the
circular loop, the arcs of these big circles would
appear as straight lines. Every point on the wire
carrying  current  would  give  rise  to  the
magnetic ﬁeld appearing as straight lines at the
center of the loop. By applying the right hand
rule, it is easy to check that every section of the
wire contributes to the magnetic ﬁeld lines in
the same direction within the loop.

292

Figure 12.8
Magnetic ﬁeld lines of the ﬁeld
produced by a current-carrying
circular loop

  We know that the magnetic ﬁeld produced
by  a  current-carrying  wire  at  a  given  point
depends directly on the current passing through
it. Therefore, if there is a circular coil having n
turns, the ﬁeld produced is n times as large as
that produced by a single turn. This is because
the current in each circular turn has the same
direction, and the ﬁeld due to each turn then just
adds up.

* This rule is also called Maxwell’s corkscrew rule. If we
consider ourselves driving a corkscrew in the direction
of  the  current,  then  the  direction  of  the  rotation  of
corkscrew is the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld..

■ Take  a  rectangular  cardboard  having

two holes. Insert a circular coil having

large  number  of  turns  through  them,

normal to the plane of the cardboard.
■ Connect  the  ends  of  the  coil  in  series

with a battery, a key and a rheostat, as

shown in Fig. 12.9.

3.  Why  don’t  two  magnetic  ﬁeld  lines

by  a  current-carrying  wire  at  a  given  point

  We know that the magnetic ﬁeld produced

the magnetic ﬁeld (at any point below or above

the  wire)  turns  clockwise  in  a  plane

perpendicular to the wire, when viewed from

the east end, and anti-clockwise, when viewed

from the west end.

12.2.3 Magnetic Field due to a Current

through a Circular Loop

We have so far observed the pattern of

the  magnetic  ﬁeld  lines  produced  around  a

current-carrying  straight  wire.  Suppose  this

straight wire is bent in the form of a circular

loop  and  a  current  is  passed  through  it.  How

would  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  lines  look  like? We

know  that  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  produced  by  a

current-carrying  straight  wire  depends

inversely on the distance from it. Similarly at

every point of a current-carrying circular loop,

the  concentric  circles  representing  the

magnetic ﬁeld around it would become larger

and larger as we move away from the wire (Fig.

12.8). By the time we reach at the centre of the

circular loop, the arcs of these big circles would

appear as straight lines. Every point on the wire

carrying  current  would  give  rise  to  the

magnetic ﬁeld appearing as straight lines at the

center of the loop. By applying the right hand

rule, it is easy to check that every section of the

wire contributes to the magnetic ﬁeld lines in

the same direction within the loop.

292

Figure 12.8

Magnetic ﬁeld lines of the ﬁeld

produced by a current-carrying

circular loop

depends directly on the current passing through

it. Therefore, if there is a circular coil having n

turns, the ﬁeld produced is n times as large as

that produced by a single turn. This is because

the current in each circular turn has the same

direction, and the ﬁeld due to each turn then just

adds up.

* This rule is also called Maxwell’s corkscrew rule. If we

consider ourselves driving a corkscrew in the direction

of  the  current,  then  the  direction  of  the  rotation  of

corkscrew is the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld..

■ Take  a  rectangular  cardboard  having

two holes. Insert a circular coil having

large  number  of  turns  through  them,

normal to the plane of the cardboard.

■ Connect  the  ends  of  the  coil  in  series

with a battery, a key and a rheostat, as

shown in Fig. 12.9.

Compare  the  pattern  of  the  ﬁeld  with  the
magnetic ﬁeld around a bar magnet (Fig. 12.4).
Do they look similar? Yes, they are similar. In
fact,  one  end  of  the  solenoid  behaves  as  a
magnetic north pole, while the other behaves as
the  south  pole.  The  ﬁeld  lines  inside  the
solenoid  are  in  the  form  of  parallel  straight
lines. This indicates that the magnetic ﬁeld is
the same at all points inside the solenoid. That
is, the ﬁeld is uniform inside the solenoid.

A strong magnetic ﬁeld produced inside a
solenoid can be used to magnetise a piece of
magnetic material, like soft iron, when placed
inside  the  coil  (Fig.  12.11).  The  magnet  so
formed is called an electromagnet.

current  pass  through  the  loop

magnetic ﬁeld inside and outside the
loop.

2.  The magnetic ﬁeld in a given region is
uniform. Draw a diagram to represent
it.

12.3  FORCE ON A CURRENT-CARRYING
CONDUCTOR IN A MAGNETIC FIELD

We have learnt that an electric current
ﬂowing  through  a  conductor  produces  a
magnetic ﬁeld. The ﬁeld so produced exerts a
force on a magnet placed in the vicinity of the
conductor.  French  scientist  Andre  Marie
Ampere  (1775–1836)  suggested  that  the
magnet must also exert an equal and opposite
force  on  the  current-carrying  conductor.  The
force  due  to  a  magnetic  ﬁeld  acting  on  a
c u r r e n t - c a r r y i n g   c o n d u c t o r   c a n   b e
demonstrated through the following activity.

Figure 12.12
A current-carrying rod, AB, experiences
a force perpendicular to its length and
the magnetic ﬁeld. Support for the magnet
is not shown here, for simplicity.

■ Take  a  small  aluminium  rod  AB  (of
about  5  cm).  Using  two  connecting
wires  suspend  it  horizontally  from  a
stand, as shown in Fig. 12.12.

■ Place  a  strong  horse-shoe  magnet  in
such a way that the rod lies between the
two  poles  with  the  magnetic  ﬁeld
directed  upwards.  For  this  put  the
north  pole  of  the  magnet  vertically
below and south pole vertically above
the aluminium rod (Fig. 12.12).

■ Connect  the  aluminium  rod  in  series
with a battery, a key and a rheostat.
■ Now  pass  a  current  through  the
aluminium rod from end B to end A.
■ What do you observe? It is observed
that  the  rod  is  displaced  towards  the
left. You will notice that the rod gets
displaced.

■ Reverse  the  direction  of  current
ﬂowing  through  the  rod  and  observe
the direction of its displacement. It is
now towards the right.

      Why does the rod get displaced?

The displacement of the rod in the above
activity suggests that a force is exerted on the
current-carrying  aluminium  rod  when  it  is
placed in a magnetic ﬁeld. It also suggests that
the direction of force is also reversed when the
direction  of  current  through  the  conductor  is
reversed. Now change the direction of ﬁeld to
vertically downwards by interchanging the two
poles of the magnet. It is once again observed
that the direction of force acting on the current-
carrying  rod  gets  reversed.  It  shows  that  the
direction of the force on the conductor depends
upon the direction of current and the direction
of the magnetic ﬁeld. Experiments have shown
that the displacement of the rod is largest (or the

CONDUCTOR IN A MAGNETIC FIELD

We have learnt that an electric current

ﬂowing  through  a  conductor  produces  a

magnetic ﬁeld. The ﬁeld so produced exerts a

force on a magnet placed in the vicinity of the

conductor.  French  scientist  Andre  Marie

Ampere  (1775–1836)  suggested  that  the

magnet must also exert an equal and opposite

force  due  to  a  magnetic  ﬁeld  acting  on  a

c u r r e n t - c a r r y i n g   c o n d u c t o r   c a n   b e

demonstrated through the following activity.

■ Take  a  small  aluminium  rod  AB  (of

about  5  cm).  Using  two  connecting

wires  suspend  it  horizontally  from  a

stand, as shown in Fig. 12.12.

■ Place  a  strong  horse-shoe  magnet  in

such a way that the rod lies between the

two  poles  with  the  magnetic  ﬁeld

directed  upwards.  For  this  put  the

north  pole  of  the  magnet  vertically

below and south pole vertically above

the aluminium rod (Fig. 12.12).

■ Connect  the  aluminium  rod  in  series

with a battery, a key and a rheostat.

■ Now  pass  a  current  through  the

aluminium rod from end B to end A.

■ What do you observe? It is observed

that  the  rod  is  displaced  towards  the

left. You will notice that the rod gets

displaced.

■ Reverse  the  direction  of  current

ﬂowing  through  the  rod  and  observe

the direction of its displacement. It is

now towards the right.

The displacement of the rod in the above

activity suggests that a force is exerted on the

current-carrying  aluminium  rod  when  it  is

placed in a magnetic ﬁeld. It also suggests that

the direction of force is also reversed when the

direction  of  current  through  the  conductor  is

reversed. Now change the direction of ﬁeld to

vertically downwards by interchanging the two

poles of the magnet. It is once again observed

that the direction of force acting on the current-

carrying  rod  gets  reversed.  It  shows  that  the

direction of the force on the conductor depends

upon the direction of current and the direction

of the magnetic ﬁeld. Experiments have shown

that the displacement of the rod is largest (or the

magnitude of the force is the highest) when the
direction  of  current  is  at  right  angles  to  the
direction  of  the  magnetic  ﬁeld.  In  such  a
condition we can use a simple rule to ﬁnd the
direction of the force on the conductor.

In  Activity  12.7,  we  considered  the
direction of the current and that of the magnetic
ﬁeld perpendicular to each other and found that
the force is perpendicular to both of them. The
three  directions  can  be  illustrated  through  a
simple  rule,  called  Fleming’s  left-hand  rule.
According  to  this  rule,  stretch  the  thumb,
foreﬁnger and middle ﬁnger of your left hand
such that they are mutually perpendicular (Fig.
12.13). If the ﬁrst ﬁnger points in the direction
of magnetic ﬁeld and the second ﬁnger in the
direction of current, then the thumb will point
in the direction of motion or the force acting on
the conductor.

conductors and magnetic ﬁelds include electric
motor,  electric  generator,  loudspeakers,

Example 12.2

An  electron  enters  a  magnetic  ﬁeld  at  right
angles  to  it,  as  shown  in  Fig.  12.14.  The

Magnetism in medicine
An  electric  current  always  produces  a
magnetic  ﬁeld.  Even  weak  ion  currents
that  travel  along  the  nerve  cells  in  our
body produce magnetic ﬁelds. When we
touch  something,  our  nerves  carry  an
electric impulse to the muscles we need to
use. This impulse produces a temporary
magnetic ﬁeld. These ﬁelds are very weak
and are about one-billionth of the earth’s
magnetic  ﬁeld.  Two  main  organs  in  the
human  body  where  the  magnetic  ﬁeld
produced is signiﬁcant, are the heart and
the  brain.  The  magnetic  ﬁeld  inside  the
body  forms  the  basis  of  obtaining  the
images  of  diﬀerent  body  parts.  This  is
done  using  a  technique  called  Magnetic
Resonance  Imaging  (MRI). Analysis  of
these images helps in medical diagnosis.
Magnetism has, thus, got important uses
in medicine.

12.4 DOMESTIC ELECTRIC CIRCUITS

In  our  homes,  we  receive  supply  of
electric  power  through  a  main  supply  (also
called  mains),  either  supported  through
overhead  electric  poles  or  by  underground
cables. One of the wires in this supply, usually
with red insulation cover, is called live wire (or
positive). Another wire, with black insulation,
is  called  neutral  wire  (or  negative).  In  our
country,  the  potential  difference  between  the
two is 220 V.

At  the  meter-board  in  the  house,  these
wires pass into an electricity meter through a
main fuse. Through the main switch they are

300

connected to the line wires in the house. These
wires  supply  electricity  to  separate  circuits
within the house. Often, two separate circuits
are  used,  one  of  15A  current  rating  for
appliances with higher power ratings such as
geysers, air coolers, etc. The other circuit is of
5A current rating for bulbs, fans, etc. The earth
wire, which has insulation of green colour, is
usually connected to a metal plate deep in the
earth near the house. This is used as a safety
measure,  especially  for  those  appliances  that
have  a  metallic  body,  for  example,  electric
press,  toaster,  table  fan,  refrigerator,  etc. The
metallic  body  is  connected  to  the  earth  wire,
which  provides  a  low-resistance  conducting
path for the current. Thus, it ensures that any
leakage of current to the metallic body of the
appliance keeps its potential to that of the earth,
and the user may not get a severe electric shock.

of the common domestic circuits

Figure 12.15 gives a schematic diagram
of one of the common domestic circuits. In each
separate  circuit,  different  appliances  can  be
connected  across  the  live  and  neutral  wires.
Each  appliance  has  a  separate  switch  to
‘ON’/‘OFF’ the ﬂow of current through it. In
order  that  each  appliance  has  equal  potential
difference, they are connected parallel to each
other.

Electric fuse is an important component of
all domestic circuits. We have already studied
the  principle  and  working  of  a  fuse  in  the
previous chapter (see Section 11.7). A fuse in a
circuit prevents damage to the appliances and
the circuit due to overloading. Overloading can
occur when the live wire and the neutral wire
come into direct contact. (This occurs when the
insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault
in the appliance.) In such a situation, the current
in the circuit abruptly increases. This is called
short-circuiting.  The  use  of  an  electric  fuse
prevents the electric circuit and the appliance
from a possible damage by stopping the ﬂow of
unduly high electric current. The Joule heating
that takes place in the fuse melts it to break the
electric circuit. Overloading can also occur due
to  an  accidental  hike  in  the  supply  voltage.
Sometimes  overloading  is  caused  by
connecting  too  many  appliances  to  a  single
socket.

2.  An electric oven of 2 kW power rating

is  operated  in  a  domestic  electric

circuit (220 V) that has a current rating

of  5  A.  What  result  do  you  expect?

Explain.

3.  What  precaution  should  be  taken  to

avoid  the  overloading  of  domestic

electric circuits?

■ A current-carrying conductor when placed in a magnetic ﬁeld experiences a force. If the
direction of the ﬁeld and that of the current are mutually perpendicular to each other, then
the force acting on the conductor will be perpendicular to both and will be given by
Fleming’s left-hand rule.

■ In our houses we receive AC electric power of 220 V with a frequency of 50 Hz. One of
the wires in this supply is with red insulation, called live wire. The other one is of black
insulation, which is a neutral wire. The potential difference between the two is 220 V. The
third is the earth wire that has green insulation and this is connected to a metallic body
deep inside earth. It is used as a safety measure to ensure that any leakage of current to a
metallic body does not give any severe shock to a user.

■ A current-carrying conductor when placed in a magnetic ﬁeld experiences a force. If the

direction of the ﬁeld and that of the current are mutually perpendicular to each other, then

the force acting on the conductor will be perpendicular to both and will be given by

Fleming’s left-hand rule.

■ In our houses we receive AC electric power of 220 V with a frequency of 50 Hz. One of

the wires in this supply is with red insulation, called live wire. The other one is of black

insulation, which is a neutral wire. The potential difference between the two is 220 V. The

third is the earth wire that has green insulation and this is connected to a metallic body

deep inside earth. It is used as a safety measure to ensure that any leakage of current to a

metallic body does not give any severe shock to a user.

■ Fuse is the most important safety device, used for protecting the circuits due to short-

circuiting or overloading of the circuits.

1.  Which  of  the  following  correctly  describes  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  near  a  long

straight wire?

(a)  The ﬁeld consists of straight lines perpendicular to the wire.

(b)   The ﬁeld consists of straight lines parallel to the wire.

(c)  The ﬁeld consists of radial lines originating from the wire.

(d)  The ﬁeld consists of concentric circles centred on the wire.

2.  At the time of short circuit, the current in the circuit

(a)  reduces substantially.

(c)  increases heavily.

(b)

(d)

does not change.

vary continuously.

3.  State whether the following statements are true or false.

(a)  The  ﬁeld  at  the  centre  of  a  long  circular  coil  carrying  current  will  be

parallel straight lines.

(b)  A wire with a green insulation is usually the live wire of an electric supply.

4.  List two methods of producing magnetic ﬁelds.

5.  When is the force experienced by a current–carrying conductor placed in a magnetic

ﬁeld largest?

6.  Imagine that you are sitting in a chamber with your back to one wall. An electron beam,

moving horizontally from back wall towards the front wall, is deﬂected by a strong

magnetic ﬁeld to your right side. What is the direction of magnetic ﬁeld?

7.  State  the  rule  to  determine  the  direction  of  a  (i)  magnetic  ﬁeld  produced  around  a

straight  conductor-carrying  current,  (ii)  force  experienced  by  a  current-carrying

straight  conductor  placed  in  a  magnetic  ﬁeld  which  is  perpendicular  to  it,  and

(iii) current induced in a coil due to its rotation in a magnetic ﬁeld.

Class X

Suggested Pedagogical Processes
The  learners  may  be  provided  with
opportunities  individually  or  in  groups
and encouraged to —
y	recognise

the  difference  between
reactions,  such  as,  exothermic  and
endothermic,  oxidation  and  reduction,
etc.

y	observe to understand the difference in
the temperatures in both the reactions
using laboratory thermometer.

y	investigate  the  ways  of  segregation  of
waste  material  on  the  basis  of  their
degradation  property.  They  may  be
encouraged to practice the segregation
of  waste  before  disposal  at  home,
school, and public places.

y	explore  the  relationship  between  two
physical  quantities,  such  as,  between
potential difference across a conductor
and electric current flowing through it;
design, conduct, and share the findings
of an activity

y	find out ‘why’ and ‘how’ of processes or
phenomena, such as, transportation in
plants and animals, extraction of metals
from  ores,  with  the  help  of  activities,
experiments,  and  demonstration.  The
learners may be encouraged to discuss,
relate,  conclude  and  explain  processes
or  phenomena  to  their  peers  using
interdisciplinary approach.

y	observe  diagrams,  such  as  that  of
digestive  system  and  the  names  given
to various organs. The learners may be
motivated to make poster of the digestive
system  for  displaying  in  school.  They
may  also  be  provided  opportunities  to
use ICT tools for drawing.

or

y	collect  wide  variety  of  graphs  from
newspapers,  magazines,
the
internet,  with  a  view  to  understand
the information contained therein. The
learners  may  be  facilitated  to  draw  a
graph, such as V-I graph for analysing
the  relationship  between  the  potential
difference  across  a  conductor  and  the
current through it.

306

Learning Outcomes

The learner —

phenomena,

y	differentiates  materials,  objects,
organisms,
and
processes,  based  on,  properties  and
characteristics,  such  as,  autotrophic
and
nutrition,
biodegradable  and  non-biodegradable
substances, various types of reactions,
strong  and  weak  acids  and  bases,
acidic,  basic,  and  neutral  salts  using
different  indicators,  real  and  virtual
images, etc.

heterotrophic

y	classifies

materials,

phenomena,

objects,
organisms,
and
processes,  based  on  properties  and
characteristics,  such  as,  metals  and
non-metals,  acid  and  bases  on  the
basis  of  their  physical  and  chemical
properties.

y	plans and conducts investigations and
experiments  to  arrive  at  and  verify
the  facts,  principles,  phenomena,
or  to  seek  answers  to  queries  on
investigates
their  own,  such  as,
conditions  necessary  for  rusting,  tests
the  conductivity  of  various  solutions,
compares  the
foaming  capacity  of
different types of soap samples, verifies
laws of reflection and refraction of light,
Ohm’s  law,  etc.  Do  variegated  leaves
perform  photosynthesis?  Which  gas  is
evolved during fermentation? Why does
the  shoot  of  a  plant  moves  towards
light?

y	relates  processes  and  phenomena
with  causes  and  effects,  such  as,
hormones  with  their  functions,  tooth
decay with pH of saliva, growth of plants
with pH of the soil, survival of aquatic
life with pH of water, blue colour of sky
with  scattering  of  light,  deflection  of
compass needle due to magnetic effect
of electric current, etc.

y	explains  processes  and  phenomena,
such  as,  nutrition  in  human  beings
and  plants,  transportation  in  plants

Learning Outcomes at the Secondary Stage

y	study  how  chemical  equations  are
balanced  using  simple  mathematical
skills.  Discussion  may  be  conducted
on  the  significance  of  balancing  of
chemical equations.

y	get  familiar  with  New  Cartesian  Sign
Convention using illustrated cards and
may  be  given  ample  opportunities  to
apply  the  sign  convention  in  various
situations  of  reflection  by  spherical
mirrors.

y	perform  a  role-play  on  ecosystem  in  a
hypothetical  situation,  such  as,  what
will  happen  if  all  herbivores  suddenly
vanish from earth. This may be followed
by  a  discussion  about  how  the  loss  of
biodiversity  disrupts  the  food  chain
hereby  adversely  affecting  the  energy
flow in an ecosystem.

y	derive  equations,  formulae,  laws,  etc.
For example, the derivation for formula
of the equivalent resistance of resistors
in  series  (or  parallel).  They  should  be
encouraged  to  practice  the  derivation
till they are confident.

y	study  the  features  inherited  through
genes,  such  as,  attached  or
free
earlobes.  They  may  be  encouraged  to
observe  and  compare  the  earlobes  of
their  friends  with  the  earlobes  of  their
parents  and  grandparents  to  arrive  at
the conclusion that characters or traits
are  inherited  in  offsprings  from  their
parents.

y	collect print and non-print materials by
exploring  the  library  and  the  internet
about  scientists  and  their  findings  to
appreciate  how  concepts  evolved  with
time.  They  may  be  motivated  to  share
their findings by preparing posters and
performing role plays or skits.

y	encourage  learners  to  visit  science
museums, biodiversity parks, aviaries,
zoological  parks,  botanical  gardens,
fisheries, poultry farms, factories, etc.

and animals, extraction of metals from
ores, placement of elements in modern
periodic  table,  displacement  of  metals
from  their  salt  solutions  on  the  basis
of  reactivity  series,  working  of  electric
motor and generator, twinkling of stars,
advanced  sunrise  and  delayed  sunset,
formation of rainbow, etc.

y	draws labelled diagrams, flow charts,
concept  maps,  and  graphs,  such
as,  digestive,  respiratory,  circulatory,
excretory,  and  reproductive  systems,
electrolysis  of  water,  electron  dot
structure of atoms and molecules, flow
chart for extraction of metals from ores,
ray diagrams, magnetic field lines, etc.
data,
graphs,  and  figures, such as, melting
and  boiling  points  of  substances  to
differentiate between covalent and ionic
compounds, pH of solutions to predict
the  nature  of  substances,  V-I  graphs,
ray diagrams, etc.

Suggested Pedagogical Processes in an Inclusive Setup
The curriculum in a classroom is same for everyone. This means
all students can actively participate in the classroom. There can
be some students who may face learning difficulties including
language,  visual-spatial,  or  mixed  processing  problems.  They
may require additional teaching support and some adaptation
in the curriculum. By considering the specific requirements of
children with special needs, a few pedagogical processes for the
teachers are suggested:

Learning Outcomes for Science

309

y	Use multisensory approach for integrating information from

auditory, olfactory, tactile as well as visual sources.

y	Provide  learning  experiences  through  touching  objects,
materials,  organisms,  models,  etc.,  to  experience  size,
shape, texture, pattern, and changes.

y	Use embossed line diagrams for explaining texts, pictures,

graphs and flow charts, etc.

y	Use direct sensory experiences for developing concepts like

temperature, volume, etc.

y	Give opportunities to work with peers during experiments.
Rotating  partners  for  the  entire  class  would  be  a  good
strategy.

y	Allow  students  to  record  classroom  presentation  and

lectures or the text in audio format.

y	Label the pictures within the text, whenever possible. This

can be done by the students as an activity.

y	Relate the projects and experiments to real life experiences.
y	Encourage group task and peer assistance for project and

experiment work.

y	Give the project and experiment in fewer steps and sequence
the  steps  through  visual  cues.  Display  the  examples
of  completed  projects  and  experiments  in  classroom  or
laboratory for better understanding.

y	Consider alternative or less difficult activities and exercises
for the students, with same or similar learning objectives.

y	Write  all  homework  or  assignments  and

laboratory

procedural changes on the chalkboard.

y	Give the student time to finish a step in an experiment and
wait  until  the  student  indicates  that  she/he  is  ready  for
further work.

y	Topics can be taught through class projects, experiments,
examples,  etc.  Activities  can  be  conducted  through
multisensory  modes  before  explaining  any  theory  and
concept.

y	Peer support can be used wherever a figure or table has to
be drawn. Peer partner can draw with a carbon paper (for
copying).

y	Highlight and underline the key concepts.
y	Provide extra time to complete an experiment and understand

a concept.

y	Always  provide  proper  guidelines  to  arrange  the  task  in  a
planned  way.  Make  use  of  visual  aids,  graphic  organisers
and  explain  the  steps  of  experiments  and  assignment
repetitively till the child learns.

y	Sequence  maps  with  visual  cues  can  be  provided  to  the

students to understand the sequence of events.
