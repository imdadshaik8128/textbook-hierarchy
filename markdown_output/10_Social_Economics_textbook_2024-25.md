FOREWORD

The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that children’s life at school must be
linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning,
which continues to shape our system, and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The
syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea.
They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different
subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centered
system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage
children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must
recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the
information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination
is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and
initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed
body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily
time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of
teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also
determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience,
rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of
curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration
for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour
by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small
groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard work done
by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of
the advisory committee for textbooks in Social Sciences, at the secondary level, Professor Hari Vasudevan
and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor Tapas Majumdar for guiding the work of this committee.
Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for
making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations, which have generously permitted
us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. We are especially grateful to the members of the
National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary and Higher Education,
Ministry of Human Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and
Professor G.P. Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As an organisation committed to
systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments
and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision and refinement.

NOTES FOR THE TEACHER
NOTES FOR TEACHERS

CHAPTER I : DEVELOPMENT

Development  has  many  aspects.  The
purpose  of  this  chapter  is  to  enable
students to understand this idea. They
have  to  understand  that  people  have
different perspectives on development and
there are ways by which we can arrive at
common indicators for development. To
do this, we have used situations that they
can respond to in an intuitive manner; we
have also presented analysis that is more
complex and macro in nature.

How  can  countries  or  states  be
compared  using  some  selected
development  indicators  is  another
question that students would read about
in this chapter. Economic development
can be measured and income is the most
common  method
for  measuring
development.  However,  the  income
method,  though  useful,  has  several
weaknesses. Hence, we need newer ways
of looking at development using indicators
of  quality  of  life  and  environmental
sustainability.

It is necessary for you to expect the
students  to  respond  actively  in  the
classroom  and  on  a  topic  such  as  the
above, there would be wide variation in
opinion and possibility of debate. Allow
students to argue their point of view. At
the end of each section there are a few
questions and activities. These serve two
purposes:  first,  they  recap  the  ideas
discussed in the section and second, they
enable better understanding of the themes

discussed by bringing the learners closer
to their real-life situations.

There are certain terms used in this
chapter that would require clarification —
Per Capita Income, Literacy Rate, Infant
Mortality  Rate,  Attendance  Ratio,  Life
Expectancy, Gross Enrolment Ratio, and
Human Development Index. Though data
pertaining to these terms are provided,
these would need further explanation. You
may  also  need  to  clarify  the  concept  of
Purchasing Power Parity that is used to
calculate per capita income in Table 1.6.
It is necessary to keep in mind that these
terms are used as an aid to the discussion
and not something to be memorised.

DEVELOPMENT

DEVELOPMENT
DEVELOPMENT
DEVELOPMENT

The idea of development or progress
has  always  been  with  us.  We  have
aspirations or desires about what we
would like to do and how we would
like to live. Similarly, we have ideas
about what a country should be like.
What are the essential things that we
require? Can life be better for all? How
should people live together? Can there
be  more  equality?  Development
involves  thinking  about  these
questions  and  about  the  ways  in
which we can work towards achieving
these  goals.  This  is  a  complex
task  and  in  this  chapter  we  shall
make a beginning at understanding
development.  You  will  learn  more
about these issues in greater depth
in higher classes. Also, you will find
answers to many of these questions
not just in economics but also in your
course in history and political science.
This is because the way we live today
is influenced by the past. We can’t
desire for change without being aware
of this. In the same way, it is only
through  a  democratic  political
process  that  these  hopes  and
possibilities  can  be  achieved  in
real life.

WHAT  DEVELOPMENT  PROMISES  —
DIFFERENT PEOPLE, DIFFERENT GOALS

YOU WANT A  CARCARCARCARCAR? THE WAY OUR COUNTRY IS
SET UP ALL YOU CAN HOPE FOR IS MAY  BE TO
ONE DAY OWN THE RICKSHAW YOU PULL!

L et  us  try  to  imagine  what
development or progress is likely to
mean to different persons listed in
Table 1.1. What are their aspirations?
You will find that some columns are
partially  filled.  Try  to  complete  the
table.  You  can  also  add  any  other
category of persons.

TABLE  1.1 DEVELOPMENTAL  GOALS  OF  DIFFERENT

CATEGORIES  OF  PERSONS

Category of Person

Developmental Goals / Aspirations

Landless rural labourers

More days of work and better wages; local school is able to
provide quality education for their children; there is no social
discrimination and they too can become leaders in the village.

Prosperous farmers from Punjab

Assured a high family income through higher support prices for
their crops and through hardworking and cheap labourers; they
should be able to settle their children abroad.

Farmers who depend only on
rain for growing crops

A rural woman from a land
owning family

Urban unemployed youth

A boy from a rich urban family

A girl from a rich urban family

An adivasi from Narmada valley

She gets as much freedom as her brother and is able to
decide what she wants to do in life. She is able to pursue her
studies  abroad.

Having filled Table 1.1, let us now
examine it. Do all of these persons
have the same notion of development
or progress? Most likely not.  Each
one of them seeks different things.

They  seek  things  that  are  most
important for them, i.e., that which
can fulfil their aspirations or desires.
In  fact,  at  times,  two  persons  or
groups of persons may seek things

which are conflicting.  A girl expects
as much freedom and opportunity as
her brother, and that he also shares
in the household work. Her brother
may not like this.  Similarly, to get
more electricity, industrialists may
want  more  dams.    But  this  may
submerge the land and disrupt the
lives of people who are displaced – such
as tribals. They might resent this and
may prefer small check dams or tanks
to irrigate their land.

INCOME AND OTHER GOALS

If you go over Table 1.1 again, you
will notice one common thing: what
people desire are regular work, better
wages, and decent price for their crops
or other products that they produce.
In  other  words,  they  want  more
income.

Besides seeking more income, one-
way  or  the  other,  people  also  seek
things like equal treatment, freedom,
security, and respect of others. They
resent discrimination. All these are
important goals. In fact, in some cases,
these may be more important than

more income or more consumption
because  material  goods  are  not  all
that you need to live.

Money, or material things that one
can buy with it, is one factor on which
our life depends. But the quality of our
life  also  depends  on  non-material
things mentioned above.  If it is not
obvious to you, then just think of the
role of your friends in your life. You
may desire their friendship.  Similarly,
there are many things that are not
easily measured but they mean a lot
to our lives. These are often ignored.

However, it will be wrong to conclude
that what cannot be measured is not
important.

Consider another example. If you
get  a  job  in  a  far  off  place,  before
accepting it you would try to consider
many  factors,  apart  from  income,
such  as  facilities  for  your  family,
working atmosphere, or opportunity
to learn. In another case, a job may
give you less pay but may offer regular
employment  that  enhances  your
sense  of  security.  Another  job,
however, may offer high pay but no
job security and also leave no time for
your  family.  This  will  reduce  your
sense of security and freedom.

true that if women are engaged in paid
work, their dignity in the household
and society increases. However, it is
also the case that if there is respect
for  women  there  would  be  more
sharing  of  housework  and  a
greater  acceptance  of  women
working outside. A safe and secure
environment may allow more women
to  take  up  a  variety  of  jobs  or  run
a business.

Hence,  the  developmental  goals
that people have are not only about
better income but also about other
important things in life.

LET’S  WORK  THESE  OUT

1. Why do different persons have different notions of development? Which of the following

explanations  is  more  important  and  why?

(a)
(b)

Because people are different.
Because life situations of persons are different.

2. Do the following two statements mean the same? Justify your answer.

(a)
(b)

People have different developmental goals.
People have conflicting developmental goals.

3. Give some examples where factors other than income are important aspects of our lives.

4. Explain some of the important ideas of the above section in your own words.

NATIONAL  DEVELOPMENT

If, as we have seen above, individuals
seek different goals, then their notion
of national development is also likely
to  be  different.  Discuss  among
yourselves on what India should do
for development.

Most  likely,  you  would  find  that
different students in the class have given
different answers to the above question.
In  fact,  you  might  yourself  think  of
many different answers and not be too

However,  can  all  the  ideas  be
considered equally important? Or, if
there  are  conflicts  how  does  one
decide? What would be a fair and just
path for all?  We also have to think
whether there is a better way of doing
things. Would the idea benefit a large
number  of  people  or  only  a  small
group?  National development means
thinking about these questions.

LET’S  WORK  THESE  OUT

Discuss the following situations:

1. Look  at  the  picture  on  the  right.  What  should
be the developmental goals for such an area?

2. Read  this  newspaper  report  and  answer  the

questions  that  follow:

A  vessel  dumped  500  tonnes
of  liquid  toxic  wastes  into
open-air dumps in a city and
in  the  surrounding  sea.  This
happened  in  a  city  called
Abidjan  in  Ivory  Coast,  a
country  in  Africa.  The  fumes
from  the  highly  toxic  waste
caused  nausea,  skin  rashes,
fainting, diarrhoea etc. After a
month  seven  persons  were
dead,  twenty  in  hospital  and
twenty  six  thousand  treated
for symptoms of poisoning.
A  multinational  company
dealing  in  petroleum  and
metals had contracted a local
company of the Ivory Coast to
dispose  the  toxic  waste  from
its ship.

(i) Who  are  the  people  who  benefited

and who did not?

(ii) What should be the developmental

goal for this country?

3. What can be some of the developmental goals for your village, town or locality?

ACTIVITY  1

If  even  the  idea  of  what  constitutes
development  can  be  varied  and
conflicting, then certainly there can be
differences about ways of developing.  If
you  know  of  any  such
controversy,  try  to  find  out
arguments advanced by different
people.  You  may  do  so  by  talking  to
different  persons  or  you  may  find  it
from newspapers and television.

HOW  TO  COMPARE  DIFFERENT  COUNTRIES
OR  STATES?

You  might  ask  if  development  can
mean different things, how come some
countries  are  generally  called
developed  and  others  under-
developed?  Before we come to this,
let us consider another question.

When we compare different things,
they could have similarities as well as
differences. Which aspects do we use
to  compare  them?  Let  us  look  at
students in the class itself.  How do
we compare different students?  They
differ in their height, health, talents
and interests. The healthiest student
may not be the most studious one.
The most intelligent student may not
be the friendliest one.  So, how do we
compare students? The criterion we
may use depends on the purpose of
comparison.  We use different criterion
to  choose  a  sports  team,  a  debate
team,  a  music  team  or  a  team  to
organise a picnic.  Still, if for some
purpose,  we  have  to  choose  the
criterion for the all-round progress of
children in the class, how shall we
do it?

Usually  we  take  one  or  more

course, there can be differences about
what are important characteristics
that  should  form  the  basis  of
comparison: friendliness and spirit of
cooperation,  creativity  or  marks
secured?

This  is  true  of  development  too.

Countries  with  higher  income  are

more developed than others with less
income.  This  is  based  on  the
understanding  that  more  income
means more of all things that human
beings need.  Whatever people like,
and should have, they will be able to
get with greater income. So, greater
income itself is considered to be one
important goal.

Now,  what  is  the  income  of  a
country? Intuitively, the income of the
country  is  the  income  of  all  the
residents of the country.  This gives
us the total income of the country.

However, for comparison between
countries, total income is not such an
useful measure. Since, countries have
different populations, comparing total
income will not tell us what an average
person is likely to earn. Are people in
one country better off than others in a
different country? Hence, we compare
 average income

income of the country divided by its
total population. The average income

is also called per capita income.

In  World  Development  Reports,
brought out by the World Bank, this
criterion  is  used  in  classifying
countries. Countries with per capita
income of US$ 49,300 per annum and
above in 2019, are called high income
or rich countries and those with per
capita income of US$ 2500 or less are
called  low-income  countries.  India
comes in the category of low middle
income  countries  because  its  per
capita  income  in  2019  was  just
US$ 6700  per  annum.  The  rich
countries,  excluding  countries  of
Middle East and certain other small
countries,  are  generally  called
developed countries.

Will you be equally happy to live in both these
countries? Are both equally developed? Perhaps
some of us may like to live in country B if we are

assured of being its fifth citizen
but if it is a lottery that decides
our citizenship number then
perhaps most of us will prefer to
live in country A. Even though
both the countries have identical
average income, country A is
preferred because it has more
equitable distribution.  In this
country people are neither very
rich nor extremely poor. On the
other hand most citizens in
country B are poor and one
person is extremely rich. Hence,
while average income is useful for
comparison it does not tell us how
this income is distributed among
people.

looked  at
When  we
individual  aspirations  and
goals, we found that people
not  only  think  of  better
income  but  also  have  goals
such as security, respect for
others,  equal  treatment,
freedom,  etc.  in  mind.
Similarly, when we think of a
nation or a region, we may,
besides  average  income,
think  of  other  equally
important attributes.

What could these attributes be? Let
us examine this through an example.
Table 1.3 gives the per capita income
of  Haryana,  Kerala    and  Bihar.
Actually,  these  figures  are  of  Per
Capita Net State Domestic Product at
Current Prices for 2018–19. Let us
ignore  what  this  complicated  term
exactly means. Roughly, we can take
it to be the per capita income of the
state.  We  find  that  of  the  three,
Haryana has the highest per capita

income and Bihar is at the bottom.
This  means  that,  on  an  average,
a  person  in  Haryana  earned
Rs 2,36,147 in one year whereas, on
an average, a person in Bihar earned
only around Rs 40,982. So, if per
capita income were to be used as the
measure of development, Haryana will
be considered the most developed
and Bihar the least developed state of
the three. Now, let us look at certain
other data pertaining to these states
given in Table 1.4.

What does this table show?  The
first column of the table shows that
in Kerala, out of 1000 children born,
7 died before completing one year of
age but in Haryana the proportion of
children dying within one year of birth
was 30, which is nearly three times
more  than  that  of  Kerala.  On  the
other hand, the per capita income of
Haryana is more than that of Kerala
as shown in Table 1.3. Just think of
how  dear  you  are  to  your  parents,
think of how every one is so happy
when  a  child  is  born.    Now,  try  to
think of parents whose children die
before they even celebrate their first
birthday. How painful it must be to
these parents?  Next, note the year to
which this data pertains. It is 2018.
So we are not talking of old times; it
is 70 years after independence when
our metro cities are full of high rise
buildings and shopping malls!

PUBLIC  FACILITIES

How  is  it  that  the  average  person  in
Haryana  has  more  income  than  the
average  person  in  Kerala  but  lags
behind  in  these  crucial  areas?  The
money  in  your  pocket
money  in  your  pocket
reason  is  —  money  in  your  pocket
money  in  your  pocket
money  in  your  pocket
cannot  buy  all  the  goods  and  services
cannot  buy  all  the  goods  and  services

that  you  may  need  to  live  well.    So,
that  you  may  need  to  live  well.
that  you  may  need  to  live  well.
income  by  itself  is  not  a  completely
adequate  indicator  of  material  goods
and  services  that  citizens  are  able  to
use.  For example, normally, your money
cannot  buy  you  a  pollution-free
environment  or  ensure  that  you  get
unadulterated  medicines,  unless  you
can afford to shift to a community that
already  has  all  these  things.    Money
may also not be able to protect you from
infectious  diseases,  unless  the  whole
of  your  community  takes  preventive
steps.

The  problem  does  not  end  with
Infant Mortality Rate. The last column
of table 1.4 shows that about half of
the children aged 14-15 in Bihar are
not  attending school beyond Class 8.
This means that if you went to school
in Bihar nearly half of your elementary
class friends would be missing. Those
who could have been in school are not
there! If this had happened to you,
you would not be able to read what
you are reading now.

Most babies do not get basic healthcare

Actually for many of the important
things in life the best way, also the
cheapest  way,  is  to  provide  these
goods and services collectively. Just
think  –  will  it  be  cheaper  to  have
collective security for the whole locality
or  for  each  house  to  have  its  own
security staff?  What if no one, other
than you, in your village or locality is
interested in studying? Would you be
able  to  study?  Not  unless  your
parents could afford to send you to
some  private  school  elsewhere.    So
you are actually able to study because
many  other  children  also  want  to
study  and  because  many  people
believe that the government should
open  schools  and  provide  other
facilities so that all children have a
chance to study. Even now, in many
areas, children, particularly girls, are
not able to go to high school because
the  government/society  has  not
provided adequate facilities.

Kerala has a low Infant Mortality
Rate  because  it  has  adequate
provision  of  basic  health  and
educational facilities.  Similarly, in

some states, the Public Distribution
System (PDS) functions well.  Health
and nutritional status of people of
such states is certainly likely to be
better.

LET’S  WORK  THESE  OUT

1. Look at data in Tables 1.3 and 1.4. Is Haryana ahead of Kerala
in literacy rate etc., as it is in terms of per capita income?

2. Think  of  other  examples  where  collective  provision  of  goods

and services is cheaper than individual provision.

3. Does availability of good health and educational facilities depend
only  on  amount  of  money  spent  by  the  government  on  these
facilities? What other factors could be relevant?

4. In Tamil Nadu, 90 per cent of the people living in rural areas use
a ration shop, whereas in West Bengal only 35 per cent of rural
people do so. Where would people be better off and why?

ACTIVITY  2

Study Table 1.5 carefully and fill in the blanks in the following paragraphs.  For this,
you  may  need  to  make  calculations  based  on  the  table.

TABLE  1.5 EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT OF RURAL

POPULATION  OF  UTTAR  PRADESH

Category

Male

Female

Literacy rate for rural population

Literacy rate for rural children in age group 10-14 years

Percentage of rural children aged 10-14 attending school

76%

90%

85%

54%

87%

82%

(a) The literacy rate for all age groups, including young and old, is _____ for rural
males  and  _____  for  rural  females.  However,  it  is  not  just  that  these  many
adults could not attend school but that there are _____ who are currently not in
school.

 (b) It is clear from the table that _____ % of rural girls and _____% of rural boys are
not attending school. Therefore, illiteracy among children in the age group 10-
14 is as high as _____% for rural females and _____% for rural males.
 (c) This high level of illiteracy among __________ age group, even after more than
70 years of our independence, is most disturbing. In many other states also we
are nowhere near realisation of the constitutional goal of free and compulsory
education for all children up to the age of 14, which was expected to be achieved
by  1960.

ACTIVITY  3

One way to find out if we are properly nourished is to
calculate what nutrition scientists call Body Mass Index
(BMI).  This  is  easy  to  calculate.  Let  each  student  in
the class find out his or her weight and height. Take the
weight  of  each  student  in  kilograms  (kg).  Then,  take
the  height  by  drawing  up  a  scale  on  the  wall  and
measuring  accurately  with  the  head  straight.  Convert
the height recorded in centimeters into meters. Divide
the weight in kg by the square of the height. The number
you  get  is  called  BMI.  Then,  look  at  the  BMI-for-Age
tables  given  on  pages
90–91.  A  student’s  BMI
could be within the normal
range  or  less  than  that
(underweight)  or  more
(obesity).  For  example,  if
a  girl  student  is  14  years
and  8  month  old  and  the
BMI  is  15.2,  then  she  is
undernourished. Similarly,
if  the  BMI  of  a  boy  aged
15 years and 6 months is
28, then he is overweight.
Discuss  the  life  situation,
food  and  exercise  habits
of  students,  in  general,
without  body  shaming
anyone.

Once it is realised that even though
the level of income is important, yet it
is an inadequate measure of the level
of development, we begin to think of
other criterion. There could be a long
list of such criterion but then it would
not be so useful. What we need is a
small number of the most important
things.  Health  and  education
indicators, such as the ones we used
in comparison of Kerala and Haryana,
are among them. Over the past decade
or so, health and education indicators
have come to be widely used along
with  income  as  a  measure  of

development. For instance, Human
Development Report
Development Report
Development Report published by
Development Report
Development Report
UNDP     compares countries based on
the educational levels of the people,
their health status and per capita
income. It would be interesting to look
at certain relevant data regarding
India and its neighbours from Human
Development Report 2020.

1. HDI stands for Human Development Index. HDI ranks in above table are out of 189 countries in

all.

2. Life Expectancy at birth denotes, as the name suggests, average expected length of life of a person

at the time of birth.

3. Per Capita Income is calculated in dollars for all countries so that it can be compared. It is also
done in a way so that every dollar would buy the same amount of goods and services in any
country.

Isn’t  it  surprising  that  a  small
country  in  our  neighbourhood,  Sri
Lanka, is much ahead of India in every
respect and a big country like ours has
such a low rank in the world? Table
1.6 also shows that though Nepal and
Bangladesh  have  low  per  capita
income than that of India, yet they are
better than India in life expectancy.

Many  improvements  have  been
suggested  in  calculating  HDI  and

many  new  components  have  been
added  to  the  Human  Development
Report but, by pre-fixing Human to
Development, it has made it very clear
that what is important in development
is what is happening to citizens of a
country.    It  is  people,  their  health,
their  well  being,  that  is  most
important.

Do  you  think  there  are  certain
other  aspects  that  should  be
considered  in  measuring  human
development?

SUSTAINABILITY  OF  DEVELOPMENT

Suppose  for  the  present  that  a
particular country is quite developed.
We would certainly like this level of
development to go up further or at
least  be  maintained  for  future
generations.  This  is  obviously
desirable.  However, since the second
half  of  the  twentieth  century,  a
number  of  scientists  have  been
warning that the present type, and
levels,  of  development  are  not
sustainable.

“We have not inherited
the world from our
forefathers — we have
borrowed it from our
children.”

LET’S UNDERSTAND WHY
THIS IS SO THROUGH THE
FOLLOWING EXAMPLE:

Example  1:  Groundwater  in  India
Example  1:  Groundwater  in  India
Example  1:  Groundwater  in  India
Example  1:  Groundwater  in  India
Example  1:  Groundwater  in  India

“Recent evidence suggests that the groundwater is under serious
threat of overuse in many parts of the country. About 300 districts
have reported a water level decline of over 4 metres during the
past 20 years. Nearly one-third of the country is overusing their
groundwater  reserves.  In  another  25  years,
60 per cent of the country would be doing the same if the present
way of using this resource continues. Groundwater overuse is
particularly found in the agriculturally prosperous regions of
Punjab and Western U.P., hard rock plateau areas of central and
south India, some coastal areas and the rapidly growing urban
settlements.”

(a) Why groundwater is overused?

(b) Can there be development without overuse?

Groundwater  is  an  example  of
renewable resources. These resources
are replenished by nature as in the
case of crops and plants. However,
even  these  resources  may  be
overused. For example, in the case
of groundwater, if we use more than
what  is  being  replenished  by  rain
then  we  would  be  overusing  this
resource.

Non-renewable  resources  are
those which will get exhausted after
a few years of use. We have a fixed
stock  on  earth  which  cannot  be
replenished.  We  do  discover  new
resources  that  we  did  not  know  of
earlier. New sources in this way add
to the stock. However, over time, even
this will get exhausted.
FOR EXAMPLE, CRUDE OIL THAT WE
EXTRACT FROM THE EARTH IS A NON-
RENEWABLE RESOURCE. HOWEVER WE
MAY FIND A SOURCE OF OIL THAT WE DID
NOT KNOW OF EARLIER. EXPLORATIONS
ARE BEING UNDERTAKEN ALL THE TIME.

The table gives an estimate of reserves of crude oil (column1). More
important, it also tells us for how many years the stock of crude oil will
last if people continue to extract it at the present rate. The reserves would
last only 50 years more. This is for the world as a whole. However,
different countries face different situations. Countries like India depend
on importing oil  from abroad because they do not have enough stocks
of their own. If prices of oil increase this becomes a burden for everyone.
There are countries like USA which have low reserves and hence want to
secure oil through military or economic power.

The question of sustainability of development raises many
fundamentally new issues about the nature and process of development.

(a) Is crude oil essential for the development process in a country?

Discuss.

(b) India has to import crude oil. What problems do you anticipate

for the country looking at the above situation?

Consequences of environmental
degradation do not respect national
or  state  boundaries;  this  issue  is
no longer region or nation specific.
Our  future  is  linked  together.
Sustainability  of  development  is
comparatively  a  new  area  of
knowledge  in  which  scientists,
economists, philosophers and other

social  scientists  are  working
together.

In  general,  the  question  of
development or progress is perennial.
At all times as a member of society
and  as  individuals  we  need  to  ask
where we want to go, what we wish
to become and what our goals are.
So  the  debate  on  development
continues.

EXERCISES

1. Development of a country can generally be determined by

its  per  capita  income
its average literacy level

(i)
(ii)
(iii) health status of its people
(iv) all the above

2. Which of the following neighbouring countries has better performance in terms of

human development than India?
(i) Bangladesh
(ii) Sri  Lanka
(iii) Nepal
(iv) Pakistan

3. Assume  there  are  four  families  in  a  country. The  average  per  capita  income  of
these families is Rs 5000. If the income of three families is Rs  4000, Rs 7000
and Rs 3000 respectively, what is the income of the fourth family?
(i) Rs 7500
(ii) Rs 3000
(iii) Rs 2000
(iv) Rs 6000

4. What  is  the  main  criterion  used  by  the  World  Bank  in  classifying  different

countries?  What  are  the  limitations  of  this  criterion,  if  any?

5. In what respects is the criterion used by the UNDP for measuring development

different from the one used by the World Bank?

6. Why do we use averages? Are there any limitations to their use? Illustrate with

your own examples related to development.

7. Kerala,  with  lower  per  capita  income  has  a  better  human  development  ranking
than Haryana. Hence, per capita income is not a useful criterion at all and  should
not  be  used  to  compare  states.  Do  you  agree?  Discuss.

8. Find out the present sources of energy that are used by the people in India. What

could be the other possibilities fifty years from now?

9. Why  is  the  issue  of  sustainability  important  for  development?

NOTES  FOR  THE  TEACHER

CHAPTER 2:   SECTORS OF THE INDIAN ECONOMY

An economy is best understood when we
study its components or sectors. Sectoral
classification can be done on the basis of
several  criteria.  In  this  chapter,  three
types  of  classifications  are  discussed:
primary/secondary/tertiary;  organised/
unorganised; and public/private. You can
create a discussion about these types by
taking examples familiar to the students
and  relate  them  to  their  daily  life.  It  is
important  to  emphasise  the  changing
roles of sectors. This can be highlighted
further  by  drawing  attention  of  the
students  to  the  rapid  growth  of  service
sector.  While  elaborating  the  ideas
provided in the chapter, the students may
need  to  be  familiarised  with  a  few
fundamental  concepts  such  as  Gross
Domestic Product, Employment etc. Since
the  students  may  find  this  difficult  to
understand, it is necessary to explain to
them through examples. Several activities
and exercises are suggested in the chapter
to  help  the  students  understand  how  a
person’s  activity  could  be  placed  —
whether  in  the  primary,  secondary  or
tertiary,  organised  or  unorganised,  and
public  or  private  sector.  You  may
encourage the students to talk to various
working  people  around  them  (such  as
shop  owners,  casual  workers,  vegetable
vendors, workshop mechanics, domestic
workers etc.) to know more about how they
live and work. Based on such information,
the  students  can  be  encouraged  to
develop  their  own  classification  of
economic activities.

Another  important  issue  to  be
highlighted is about the problems caused
by  the  changes  in  the  roles  of  sectors.
The  chapter  has  taken  the  example  of
unemployment and what the government
can do to solve it. The declining importance
of agriculture and growing importance of

industry  and  services  should  be  related
to the experience of the children by taking
more examples that they may observe in
their day-to-day life. Information derived
from  the  media  could  be  used  for  this
purpose. You may encourage the students
to  bring  important  cuttings  and  stories
from  newspapers,  which  could  be
prominently displayed in storyboards, and
encourage  the  class  to  discuss  these
issues. While discussing the unorganised
sector,  the  key  issue  of  protecting  the
workers engaged in the sector should be
highlighted. You may  also encourage the
students to visit persons and enterprises
in the unorganised sector and get a first
hand experience from real life situation.

Sources  for  Information

The  GDP  data  used  in  this  chapter
pertaining  to  Gross  Domestic  Product  at
Factor  Cost  by  Industry  of  Origin  at
2011–12  prices  is  taken  from Real Time
Handbook of Statistics on Indian Economy.
It is a valuable source of GDP and other
information relating to the Indian economy.
For  evaluation  purposes,  particularly  to
develop  the  analytical  ability  of  learners,
teachers can refer to this report through
the Internet to get data for different years.
Due to change in methodology, latest data
is  not  used  in  the  chapter.

The  employment  figures  are  based
on data taken from the five-yearly surveys
on  employment  and  unemployment
conducted by the National Sample Survey
Organisation  (NSSO)  now  known  as
National Statistical Office (NSO). NSO is
an  organisation  under  the  Ministry  of
Statistics and Programme Implementation,
Government of India. The website you can
log onto is: http:/mospi.gov.in. Employment
data is also available from other sources
such as Census of India.

SECTORS  OF  ECONOMIC  ACTIVITIES

Let us look at these pictures. You will find that people are
engaged in various economic activities. Some of these are
activities  producing  goods.  Some  others  are  producing
services. These activities are happening around us every
minute even as we speak.  How do we understand these
activities? One way of doing this is to group them (classify
them) using some important criterion. These groups are also
called sectors.

other sectors

We begin by looking at different
kind of economic activities.

There are many activities that are
undertaken  by  directly  using
n a t u r a l   r e s o u r c e s .   T a k e ,   f o r

takes place within a crop season. For

on  natural  factors  like  rainfall,

of this activity, cotton, is a natural
product. Similarly, in the case of an
activity like dairy, we are dependent
on the biological process of
the animals and availability
of fodder etc. The product
here, milk, also is a natural
product. Similarly, minerals
and  ores  are  also  natural
products. When we produce
a good by exploiting natural
resources, it is an activity of

activities in which natural products
are changed into other forms through
ways  of  manufacturing  that  we
associate with industrial activity. It is
the  next  step  after  primary.  The
product is not produced by nature
but  has  to  be  made  and  therefore
some  process  of  manufacturing  is
essential. This could be in a factory, a
workshop or at home.  For example,
using cotton fibre from the plant, we

sugarcane as a raw material, we make
sugar or gur. We convert earth into
bricks and use bricks to make houses
and  buildings.  Since  this  sector

After primary and secondary, there
is a third category of activities that falls

from  the  above  two.  These  are
activities that help in the development
of the primary and secondary sectors.
These activities, by themselves, do not
produce a good but they are an aid
or  a  support  for  the  production
process. For example, goods that are
produced in the primary or secondary
sector would need to be transported
by trucks or trains and then sold in
wholesale and retail shops. At times,
it may be necessary to store these in
godowns. We also may need to talk to
others over telephone or send letters
(communication)  or  borrow  money
from  banks  (banking)  to  help
production  and  trade.  Transport,
storage,  communication,  banking,
trade are some examples of tertiary
activities.  Since  these  activities
generate services rather than goods,
the tertiary sector is also called the
service  sector

Service sector also includes some
essential services that may not directly
help in the production of goods. For
example, we require teachers, doctors,
and  those  who  provide  personal
services such as washermen, barbers,
cobblers, lawyers, and people to do
administrative and accounting works.
In recent times, certain new services
based on information technology such
as  internet  cafe,  ATM  booths,  call
centres, software companies etc have
become important.

WHAT DOES THIS SHOW?

This is an example of the secondary or
industrial sector being dependent on
the  primary.

Imagine what would happen if farmers
refuse to sell sugarcane to a particular
sugar  mill.  The  mill  will  have  to  shut
down.

Imagine  what  would  happen  to  cotton
cultivation  if  companies  decide  not  to
buy from the Indian market and import
all  cotton  they  need  from  other
countries.  Indian  cotton  cultivation  will
become less profitable and the farmers
may  even  go  bankrupt,  if  they  cannot
quickly  switch  to  other  crops.  Cotton
prices  will  fall.

Farmers  buy  many  goods  such  as
tractors,  pumpsets,  electricity,
pesticides and fertilisers. Imagine what
would  happen  if  the  price  of  fertilisers
or pumpsets go up. Cost of cultivation
of the farmers will rise and their profits
will be reduced.

People working in industrial and service
sectors need food. Imagine what would
happen  if  there  is  a  strike  by
transporters  and  lorries  refuse  to  take
vegetables, milk, etc. from rural areas.
Food will become scarce in urban areas
whereas farmers will be unable to sell
their  products.

LET’S  WORK  THESE  OUT
1. Complete the above table to show how sectors are dependent on each other.

2.  Explain  the  difference  between  primary,  secondary  and  tertiary  sectors  using

examples  other  than  those  mentioned  in  the  text.

COMPARING  THE  THREE  SECTORS

The various production activities in the primary, secondary
and tertiary sectors produce a very large number of goods
and services. Also, the three sectors have a large number of
people working in them to produce these goods and services.
The next step, therefore, is to see how much goods and services
are produced and how many people work in each sector. In
an economy there could be one or more sectors which are
dominant in terms of total production and employment, while
other sectors are relatively small in size.

How do we count the various goods and
services and know the total production in
each sector?

With so many thousands of goods and services produced,
you might think this is an impossible task! Not only would
the task be enormous, you might also wonder how we can
add up cars and computers and nails and furniture. It won’t
make sense!!!

You are right in thinking so. To get around this problem,
economists suggest that the values of goods and services
should be used rather than adding up the actual numbers.
For example, if 10,000 kgs of wheat is sold at Rs 20 per kg,
the value of wheat will be Rs 2,00,000. The value of 5000
coconuts at Rs 15 per coconut will be Rs 75,000. Similarly,
the value of goods and services in the three sectors are
calculated, and then added up.

Remember, there is one precaution one has to take. Not
every good (or service) that is produced and sold needs to be
final goods and
final goods and
counted. It makes sense only to include the final goods and
final goods and
final goods and
services
services
services. Take, for instance, a farmer who sells wheat to a
services
services
flour mill for Rs 20 per kg. The mill grinds the wheat and sells
the flour to a biscuit company for Rs 25 per kg. The biscuit
company uses the flour and things such as sugar and oil to
make four packets of biscuits. It sells biscuits in the market to
the consumers for Rs 80 (Rs 20 per packet). Biscuits are the
final goods, i.e., goods that reach the consumers.

Why  are  only  ‘final  goods  and  services’  counted?      In
contrast to final goods, goods such as wheat and the wheat
flour in this example are intermediate goods.  Intermediate
goods are used up in producing final goods and services.
already includes

The value of final goods already includes
already includes the value of all
already includes
the intermediate goods that are used in making the final
good. Hence, the value of Rs 80 for the biscuits (final good)
already includes the value of flour (Rs 25). Similarly, the
value  of  all  other  intermediate  goods  would  have  been
included.  To  count  the  value  of  the  flour  and  wheat

In  India,  the  mammoth  task  of
measuring GDP is undertaken by a
central  government  ministry.  This
Ministry,  with  the  help  of  various
government  departments  of  all  the
Indian states and union territories,
collects information relating to total
volume of goods and services and their
prices and then estimates the GDP.

Historical Change in Sectors

Generally, it has been noted from the
histories  of  many,  now  developed,
countries  that  at  initial  stages  of
development, primary sector was the
most important sector of economic
activity.

As  the  methods  of  farming
changed and agriculture sector began
to prosper, it produced much more
food than before. Many people could
now take up other activities. There
were  increasing  number  of  craft-
persons  and  traders.  Buying  and
selling activities increased many times.
Besides, there were also transporters,
administrators, army etc. However, at
this stage, most of the goods produced
were  natural  products  from  the
primary sector and most people were
also employed in this sector.

Over  a  long  time  (more  than
hundred  years),  and  especially
of
because  new  methods
manufacturing  were  introduced,
factories  came  up  and  started
expanding.  Those  people  who  had
earlier worked on farms now began
to work in factories in large numbers.
They were forced to do so as you read
in history chapters. People began to
use  many  more  goods  that  were
produced in factories at cheap rates.
Secondary sector gradually became
the most important in total production
and employment. Hence, over time, a
shift had taken place. This means that
the  importance  of  the  sectors  had
changed.

In the past 100 years, there has
been a further shift from secondary to
tertiary sector in developed countries.
The service sector has become the most
important in terms of total production.
Most of the working people are also
employed in the service sector. This is
the  general  pattern  observed  in
developed countries.

What is the total production and
employment in the three sectors in
India? Over the years have there been
changes  similar  to  the  pattern
observed for the developed countries?
We shall see in the next section.

LET’S  WORK  THESE  OUT

1. What  does  the  history  of  developed  countries  indicate
about the shifts that have taken place between sectors?

2. Correct and arrange the important aspects for calculating

GDP from this Jumble.

To count goods and services we add the numbers that
are produced. We count all those that were produced in
the last five years. Since we shouldn’t leave out anything
we add up all these goods and services.

3. Discuss with your teacher how you could calculate the
total value of a good or service by using the method of
value added at each stage.

PRIMARY,  SECONDARY  AND  TERTIARY
SECTORS  IN  INDIA

Graph 1 : GDP by Primary, Secondary and

Tertiary  Sectors

Graph  1  shows  the
production  of  goods  and
services in the three sectors.
This is shown for two years,
1973-74 and 2013-14. We
have used the data for these
two years because the data
are  comparable  and
authentic. You can see how
the  total  production  has
grown over the forty years.

LET’S  WORK  THESE
OUT

Answer  the  following  questions  by
looking at the graph:

1. Which  was  the  largest  producing

sector in 1973-74?

2. Which  is  the  largest  producing

sector in 2013-14?

3 . Can  you  say  which  sector  has
grown the most over forty years?

4. What  was  the  GDP  of  India  in

2013-14?

What does the comparison between
1973-74 and 2013-14 show?
What conclusions can we draw
from the comparison?
Let’s find out.

Rising Importance of the
Tertiary Sector in Production

Over the forty years between 1973-74
and 2013-14, while production in all
the three sectors has increased, it has
increased the most in the tertiary sector.
As a result, in the year 2013-14, the
tertiary  sector  has  emerged  as  the
largest  producing  sector  in  India
replacing the primary sector.

Why is the tertiary sector becoming
so important in India? There could be
several reasons.

First,  in  any  country  several
services  such  as  hospitals,
educational  institutions,  post  and
telegraph  services,  police  stations,
courts, village administrative offices,
municipal  corporations,  defence,
transport,  banks,
insurance
companies, etc. are required. These
can be considered as basic services.
In  a  developing  country  the
government has to take responsibility
for the provision of these services.

Second,  the  development  of
agriculture and industry leads to the
development  of  services  such  as

transport, trade, storage and the like,
as we have already seen. Greater the
development  of  the  primary  and
secondary sectors, more would be the
demand for such services.

Third, as income levels rise, certain
sections  of  people  start  demanding
many  more  services  like  eating  out,
tourism, shopping, private hospitals,
private schools, professional training
etc.  You  can  see  this  change  quite
sharply in cities, especially in big cities.

Fourth, over the past decade or so,
certain  new  services  such  as
those  based  on  information  and
communication  technology  have
become important and essential. The
production of these services has been
rising rapidly.  In Chapter 4, we shall
see examples of these new services
and the reasons for their expansion.

However, you must remember that
not all of the service sector is growing
equally well. Service sector in India
employs  many  different  kinds  of
people. At one end there are a limited
number of services that employ highly
skilled and educated workers. At the
other  end,  there  are  a  very  large
number  of  workers  engaged  in
services such as small shopkeepers,
repair persons, transport persons,
etc. These people barely manage to
earn a living and yet they perform
these services because no alternative
opportunities for work are available
to them. Hence, only a part of this
sector is growing in importance. You
shall read more about this in the next
section.

Where are most of the people
employed?

Graph 2 presents percentage share of
the three sectors in GDP. Now you can
directly see the changing importance
of the sectors over the forty years.

Graph 2 : Share of Sectors in GDP (%)

A remarkable fact about India is
that while there has been a change
in the share of the three sectors in
GDP, a similar shift has not taken
place  in  employment.  Graph  3
shows the share of employment in
the  three  sectors  in  1977-78  and
2017-18.  T h e   p r i m a r y   s e c t o r
c o n t i n u e s   t o   b e   t h e   l a r g e s t
employer even now.

Graph 3 : Share of Sectors in Employment (%)

Why didn’t a similar shift out of
primary sector happen in case of
employment?  It  is  because  not
enough  jobs  were  created  in  the
secondary  and  tertiary  sectors.

Even though industrial output or
the  production  of  goods  went  up
by more than nine times during the
i n   t h e
p e r i o d ,   e m p l o y m e n t
industry went up by around three
times.  The  same  applies  to  the
tertiary  sector  as  well.  While
production  in  the  service  sector
rose  by  14  times,  employment  in
the service sector rose around five
times.

As a result, more than half of the
workers in the country are working
in  the  primary  sector,  mainly  in
agriculture,  producing  only  about
one sixth of the GDP. In contrast to
this,  the  secondary  and  tertiary
sectors  produce  the  rest  of  the
produce whereas they employ less
about half the people. Does this mean
that  the  workers  in  agriculture
are  not  producing  as  much  as
they could?

What  it  means  is  that  there
are more people in agriculture than
is  necessary.  So,  even  if  you  move
a  few  people  out,  production  will
not  be  affected.  In  other  words,
workers in the agricultural sector are
underemployed

growing crops, like jowar and arhar.

Why? They have nowhere else to go

in actual fact, their labour effort

of  them  are  made  to  work  less

Now,  supposing  a  landlord,
Sukhram, comes and hires one or
two members of the family to work
on his land. Laxmi’s family is now
able  to  earn  some  extra  income
through  wages.  Since  you  do  not
need five people to look after that
small plot, two people moving out
does not affect production on their
farm.  In  the  above  example,  two
people  may  move  to  work  in  a
factory. Once again the earnings of
the family would increase and they
would also continue to produce as
much from their land.

There  are  lakhs  of  farmers  like
Laxmi  in India. This means that even
if  we  remove  a  lot  of  people  from
agricultural sector and provide them
with  proper  work  elsewhere,
agricultural  production  will  not
suffer. The incomes of the people who
take up other work would increase
the total family income.

This underemployment can also
h a p p e n   i n   o t h e r   s e c t o r s .   F o r
example  there  are  thousands  of
casual  workers  in  the  service
sector in urban areas who search
for  daily  employment.  They  are
employed as painters, plumbers,
repair  persons  and  others  doing
odd jobs. Many of them don’t find
work  everyday.  Similarly,  we  see
other people of the service sector
on  the  street  pushing  a  cart  or

LET’S  WORK  THESE  OUT

1. Complete the table using the data given in Graphs 2 and 3 and answer the question

that follows. Ignore if data are not available for some years.

GDP  AND  EMPLOYMENT

1973-74

Share in GDP

Share  in  employment

What  are  the  changes  that  you  observe  in  the  primary  sector  over  a  span  of  forty
years?

2. Choose  the  correct  answer:

Underemployment  occurs  when  people

(i) do not want to work
(ii) are working in a lazy manner
(iii) are working less than what they are capable of doing
(iv) are not paid for their work

3. Compare and contrast the changes in India with the pattern that was observed for
developed countries. What kind of changes between sectors were desired but did
not happen in India?

4. Why should we be worried about underemployment?

How to Create More
Employment?

From the above discussion, we can see
that there continues to be considerable
underemployment  in  agriculture.
There  are  also  people  who  are  not
employed at all. In what ways can one
increase employment for people? Let
us look at some of them.

Take the case of Laxmi with her
two-hectare plot of unirrigated land.
The  government  can  spend  some
money or banks can provide a loan,
to construct a well for her family to
irrigate the land. Laxmi will then be
able to irrigate her land and take a
second crop, wheat, during the rabi
season.  Let  us  suppose  that  one
hectare  of  wheat  can  provide
employment to two people for 50 days
(including sowing, watering, fertiliser

application and harvesting).  So, two
more members of the family can be
employed  in  her  own  field.  Now
suppose a new dam is constructed
and canals are dug to irrigate many
such farms. This could lead to a lot
of  employment  generation  within
the  agricultural  sector  itself

problem

the

Now,  suppose  Laxmi  and  other
farmers  produce  much  more  than
before. They would also need to sell some
of this. For this they may be required to
transport their products to a nearby
town. If the government invests some
money in transportation and storage of
crops, or makes better rural roads so
that  mini-trucks  reach  everywhere
several farmers like Laxmi, who now
have access to water, can continue to
grow and sell these crops. This activity
can provide productive employment to
not just farmers but also others such
as those in services like transport or
trade.

Laxmi’s  need  is  not  confined  to
water alone. To cultivate the land, she
also  needs  seeds,  fertilisers,
agricultural equipment and pumpsets
to draw water. Being a poor farmer,
she cannot afford many of these. So,

Gur Making in
Haryana

she will have to borrow money from
moneylenders and pay a high rate of
interest.  If  the  local  bank  gives  her
credit at a reasonable rate of interest,
she will be able to buy all these in time
and cultivate her land. This means that
along  with  water,  we  also  need  to
provide cheap agricultural credit to the
farmers for farming to improve. We will
look at some of these needs in Chapter
3, Money and Credit.....

Another  way  by  which  we  can
tackle  this  problem  is  to  identify,
promote  and  locate  industries  and
services in semi-rural areas where a
large  number  of  people  may  be
employed.  For  instance,  suppose
many farmers decide to grow arhar
and chickpea (pulse crops). Setting
up a dal mill to procure and process
these and sell in the cities is one such
example. Opening a cold storage could
give  an  opportunity  for  farmers  to
store their products like potatoes and
onions and sell them when the price
is good. In villages near forest areas,
we  can  start  honey  collection
centres where farmers can come and
sell wild honey. It is also possible to
set  up  industries  that  process
vegetables and agricultural produce
like potato, sweet potato, rice, wheat,
tomato, fruits, which can be sold in
outside  markets.  This  will  provide
employment in industries located in
semi-rural areas and not necessarily
in large urban centres.

What groups of people do
you think are unemployed
or underemployed in your
area? Can you think of
some measures that could
be taken up for them?

Do you know that in India about
60 per cent of the population belongs
to the age group 5-29 years? Out of
this,  only  about  51  per  cent  are
attending  educational  institutions.
The rest and particularly those aged
less than 18 years may be at home

or many of them may be working as
child labourers.  If these children are
to  attend  schools,  we  will  require
more buildings, more teachers and
other staff. A study conducted by the
erstwhile Planning Commission  (now
known as NITI Aayog) estimates that
nearly 20 lakh jobs can be created in
the education sector alone. Similarly,
if  we  are  to  improve  the  health
situation, we need many more doctors,
nurses, health workers etc. to work
in rural areas. These are some ways
by which jobs would be created and
we would also be able to address the
important  aspects  of  development
talked about in Chapter 1.

Every state or region has potential
for  increasing  the  income  and
employment for people in that area.
It could be tourism, or regional craft
industry, or new services like IT. Some
of  these  would  require  proper
planning  and  support  from  the
government. For example, the same
study by the Planning Commission
says  that  if  tourism  as  a  sector  is
improved,  every  year  we  can  give
additional employment to more than
35 lakh people.

We must realise that some of the
suggestions discussed above would
take a long time to implement. For the
short-term,  we  need  some  quick
measures.  Recognising  this,  the
central  government  in  India  made

LET’S  WORK  THESE  OUT

1. Why do you think MGNREGA 2005 is referred to as ‘ Right to work’ ?

2.  Imagine  that  you  are  the  village  head.  In  that  capacity  suggest  some  activities  that
you think should be taken up under this Act that would also increase the income of
people?  Discuss.

3. How would income and employment increase if farmers were provided with irrigation

and  marketing  facilities?

4. In what ways can employment be increased in urban areas?

DIVISION  OF  SECTORS  AS  ORGANISED  AND
UNORGANISED
Let us examine another way of classifying activities in the economy. This
looks at the way people are employed. What are their conditions of work?
Are  there  any  rules  and  regulations  that  are  followed  as  regards  their
employment?

Kanta
Kanta
Kanta
Kanta
Kanta
Kanta works in an office. She attends her office from
9.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. She gets her salary regularly
at the end of every month. In addition to the salary,
she also gets provident fund as per the rules laid down
by the government. She also gets medical and other
allowances. Kanta does not go to office on Sundays.
This is a paid holiday. When she joined work, she
was given an appointment letter stating all the terms
and conditions of work.

Kamal
Kamal
Kamal
Kamal
Kamal
Kamal is Kanta’s neighbour. He is a
daily wage labourer in a nearby
grocery shop. He goes to the shop at
7:30 in the morning and works till 8:00
p.m. in the evening. He gets no other
allowances apart from his wages. He
is not paid for the days he does not
work. He has therefore no leave or paid
holidays. Nor was he given any formal
letter saying that  he has been
employed in the shop. He can be asked
to leave anytime by his employer.

Do you see the differences in
the  conditions  of  work
between Kanta and Kamal?

Kanta works in the organised
organised sector.
organised
Organised sector covers those enterprises
or  places  of  work  where  the  terms  of
employment  are  regular  and  therefore,
people  have  assured  work.  They  are
registered by the government and have to
follow its rules and regulations which are
given in various laws such as the Factories
Act,  Minimum  Wages  Act,  Payment  of
Gratuity Act, Shops and Establishments
Act etc. It is called organised because it
has  some  formal  processes  and

procedures. Some of these people may
not  be  employed  by  anyone  but  may
work on their own but they too have to

Workers  in  the  organised  sector
enjoy security of employment. They are
expected to work only a fixed number
of hours. If they work more, they have
to  be  paid  overtime  by  the  employer.
They also get several other benefits
from  the  employers.  What  are

often  not  regular.  There  is  no
provision  for  overtime,  paid  leave,
holidays, leave due to sickness etc.
Employment  is  not  secure.  People
can  be  asked  to  leave  without  any
reason.  When  there  is  less  work,
such as during some seasons, some
people may be asked to leave. A lot
also  depends  on  the  whims  of  the
employer.  This  sector  includes  a
large  number  of  people  who  are
employed on their own doing small
jobs such as selling on the street or
doing repair work. Similarly, farmers
work  on  their  own  and  hire
labourers as and when they require.

1. Look at the following examples. Which of these are unorganised sector activities?

(i) A teacher taking classes in a  school
(ii) A headload worker carrying a bag of cement on his back in a market
(iii) A farmer irrigating her field
(iv) A doctor in a  hospital treating a patient
(v) A daily wage labourer working under a contractor
(vi) A factory worker going to work in a big factory
(vii) A handloom weaver working in her house

2. Talk to someone who has a regular job in the organised sector and another who works in the unorganised

sector.  Compare  and  contrast  their  working  conditions  in  all  aspects.

3. How would you distinguish between organised and unorganised sectors? Explain in your own words.

4. The  table  below  shows  the  estimated  number  of  workers  in  India  in  the  organised  and  unorganised

sectors. Read the table carefully. Fill in the missing data and answer the questions that follow.

How to Protect Workers in
the Unorganised Sector?

in

The organised sector offers jobs that
are the most sought-after. But the
employment  opportunities  in  the
organised  sector  have  been
expanding  very  slowly.  It  is  also
common  to  find  many  organised
sector
the
enterprises
unorganised  sector.  They  adopt
such strategies to evade taxes and
refuse  to  follow  laws  that  protect
labourers.  As  a  result,  a  large
number  of  workers  are  forced  to
enter  the  unorganised  sector  jobs,
which pay a very low salary. They are
often  exploited  and  not  paid  a  fair
wage. Their earnings are low and not
regular.  These  jobs  are  not  secure
and have no other benefits.

Since  the  1990s,  it  is  also
common  to  see  a  large  number  of
workers  losing  their  jobs  in  the
organised sector. These workers are
forced  to  take  up  jobs  in  the
unorganised  sector  with  low
earnings.  Hence,  besides  the  need
for more work, there is also a need
for  protection  and  support  of  the
workers in the unorganised sector.

Who are these vulnerable people
who  need  protection?  In  the  rural
areas, the unorganised sector mostly
comprises  of  landless  agricultural
labourers,  small  and  marginal
farmers, sharecroppers and artisans
(such  as  weavers,  blacksmiths,
carpenters and goldsmiths). Nearly
80 per cent of rural households in
India  are  in  small  and  marginal
farmer category. These farmers need
to  be  supported  through  adequate
facility for timely delivery of seeds,
agricultural  inputs,  credit,  storage
facilities and marketing outlets.

In the urban areas, unorganised
sector comprises mainly of workers
in  small-scale  industry,  casual
workers in construction, trade and
transport etc., and those who work
as street vendors, head load workers,
garment  makers,  rag  pickers  etc.
Small-scale  industry  also  needs
government’s support for procuring
raw  material  and  marketing  of
output. The casual workers in both
rural  and  urban  areas  need  to  be
protected.

and

We  also  find  that  majority  of
workers  from  scheduled  castes,
tribes
backward
communities find themselves
in  the  unorganised  sector.
Besides getting the irregular
and  low  paid  work,  these
workers  also  face  social
discrimination.  Protection
to
and
the  unorganised  sector
workers  is  thus  necessary
for  both  economic  and
social  development.

LET’S  RECALL

With so many activities taking place around us, one needs to use the
process of classification to think in a useful manner. The criterion for
classification  could  be  many  depending  on  what  we  desire  to  find
out. The process of classification helps to analyse a situation.

In  dividing  the  economic  activities  into  three  sectors  —  primary,
secondary, tertiary — the criterion used was the ‘nature of activity’.
On the basis of this classification, we were able to analyse the pattern
of  total  production  and  employment  in  India.  Similarly,  we  divided
the economic activities into organised and unorganised and used the
classification to look at employment in the two sectors.

What was the most important conclusion that was derived from the
classification exercises? What were the problems and solutions that
were indicated? Can you summarise the information in the following
table?

Another way of classifying economic
activities  into  sectors  could  be  on
the basis of who owns assets and is
responsible for the delivery of services.

all the services. In the private
private sector,
private
ownership of assets and delivery of
services  is  in  the  hands  of  private
individuals or companies. Railways or
post office is an example of the public
sector whereas companies like Tata
Iron  and  Steel  Company  Limited
(TISCO)  or  Reliance  Industries
Limited (RIL) are privately owned.

Activities in the private sector are
guided by the motive to earn profits.

To get such services we have to pay
money  to  these  individuals  and
companies. The purpose of the public
sector  is  not  just  to  earn  profits.
Governments raise money through
taxes and other ways to meet expenses
on the services rendered by it. Modern
day governments spend on a whole
range  of  activities.  What  are  these
activities? Why do governments spend
on such activities? Let’s find out.

of the private sector. Also, collecting
money from thousands of people who
use these facilities is not easy. Even
if they do provide these things they
would  charge  a  high  rate  for  their
use.  Examples  are  construction  of
roads, bridges, railways, harbours,
generating  electricity,  providing
irrigation through dams etc.  Thus,
governments have to undertake such
heavy    spending  and  ensure  that
these  facilities  are  available  for
everyone.

There are some activities, whichwhichwhichwhichwhich

private sector may not continue their
production  or  business  unless
government  encourages  it.  For
example, selling electricity at the cost
of generation may push up the costs
of  production  of  goods  in  many
industries.  Many  units,  especially
small-scale units, might have to shut
down. Government here steps in by
producing and supplying electricity
at rates which these industries can
afford. Government has to bear part
of the cost.

Similarly, the Government in India
buys wheat and rice from farmers at
a  ‘fair  price’.  This  it  stores  in  its
godowns and sells at a lower price to
consumers through ration shops. You
have read about this in the chapter
on  Food  Security  in  Class  IX.  The

government has to bear some of the
cost.  In  this  way,  the  government
supports both farmers and consumers.

There  are  a  large  number  of
activities  which  are  the  primary
responsibility of the government. TheTheTheTheThe
government  must  spend  on  these.

Providing  health  and  education
facilities  for  all  is  one  example.  We
have discussed some of these issues
in  the  first  chapter.  Running  proper
schools  and  providing  quality
education,  particularly  elementary
education,  is  the  duty  of  the
government.  India’s  size  of  illiterate
population is one of the largest in the
world.

Similarly, we know that nearly half
of India’s children are malnourished
and  a  quarter  of  them  are  critically
ill.  We  have  read  about  Infant
Mortality Rates. The infant mortality
rate of Odisha (40) or Madhya Pradesh
(48) is higher than some of the poorest
regions  of  the  world.  Government
also needs to pay attention to aspects
of  human  development  such  as
availability  of  safe  drinking  water,
housing  facilities  for  the  poor  and
food and nutrition.  It is also the duty
of the government to take care of the
poorest and most ignored regions of
the  country  through  increased
spending in such areas.

SUMMING  UP

In this chapter we have looked at ways of
classifying  economic  activities  into  some
meaningful groups. One way of doing this
is to examine whether the activity relates
to  the  primary,  secondary  or  tertiary
sectors. The data for India, for the last thirty
years, shows that while  goods and services
produced in the tertiary sector contribute
the most to GDP, the employment remains
in the primary sector. We have also seen

what  all  can  be  done  for  increasing
employment  opportunities  in  the  country.
Another classification is to consider whether
people  are  working  in  organised  or
unorganised  sectors.  Most  people  are

NOTES  FOR  THE  TEACHER
CHAPTER 3 : MONEY AND CREDIT

Money  is  a  fascinating  subject  and  full  of
curiosities.  It  is  important  to  capture  this
element  for  the  students.  The  history  of
money and how various forms were used at
different times is an interesting story. At this
stage  the  purpose  is  to  allow  students  to
realise  the  social  situation  in  which  these
forms were used. Modern forms of money are
linked  to  the  banking  system.  This  is  the
central idea of the first part of the chapter.

The  present  situation  in  India,  where
newer forms of money are slowly spreading
with computerisation of the banking system,
offers  many  opportunities  to  students  to
explore on their own. We need not get into a
formal discussion of the ‘functions of money’
but  let  it  come  up  as  questions.  There  are
certain areas that are not covered, such as
‘creation of money’ (money multiplier) or the
backing of the modern system that may be
discussed if you desire.

As you would see in the chapter, the stock
of  money  consists  of  currency  held  by  the
public and the demand deposits that they hold
with the banks. This is the money that people
can use as they wish and the government has
to  ensure  that  the  system  works  smoothy.
What  would  happen  when  the  government
declares that some of the currency notes used
by people would be made invalid and would be
replaced  by  new  currency?  In  India,  during
November  2016,  currency  notes  in  the
denomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 were
declared  invalid.  People  were  asked  to
surrender these notes to the bank by a specific
period and receive new Rs. 500, Rs. 2,000 or
other  currency  notes.  This  is  known  as
‘demonetisation’. Since then, people were also
encouraged to use their bank deposits rather
than  cash  for  transactions.  Hence,  digital
transactions  started  by  using  bank-to-bank
transfer  through  the  internet  or  mobile
phones,  cheques,  ATM  cards,  credit  cards,
and  Point  of  Sale  (POS)  swipe  machines  at
shops.  This  is  promoted  to  reduce  the
requirement of cash for transactions and also
control  corruption.  Students  could  be  asked
to  debate  on  the  process  and  the  impact  of
demonetisation. They can be guided to make

a collage of the major areas where people use
digital  and  cash  transactions  which  are
legitimate and legal. They can also discuss the
transactions which are legal and why. It is also
important  to  intimate  students  that  different
types of plastic cards are used in place of cash
transactions but not all of them money per se.

Credit  is  a  crucial  element  in  economic
life  and  it  is,  therefore,  important  to  first
understand  this  in  a  conceptual  manner.
What  are  the  aspects  that  one  looks  at  in
any credit arrangement and how this affects
people is the main focus of the second part
of the chapter. The world around us offers a
tremendous  variety  of  such  arrangements
and  it  would  be  ideal  to  explain  these
aspects  of  credit  from  situations  that  are
familiar to your students. The other crucial
issue  of  credit  is  its  availability  to  all,
especially  the  poor,  and  on  reasonable
terms. We need to emphasise that this is a
right of the people and without which a large
section  of  them  would  be  kept  out  of  the
development  process.  There  are  many
innovative  interventions,  such  as  that  of
Grameen  Bank,  of  which  students  may  be
made  familiar  with  but  it  is  important  to
realise  that  we  don’t  have  answers  to  all
questions.  We  need  to  find  new  ways  and
this  is  one  of  the  social  challenges  that
developing  countries  face.

MONEY AS A MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE

The use of money spans a very large
part of our everyday life. Look around
you and you would easily be able to
identify several transactions involving
money  in  any  single  day.  Can  you
make a list of these? In many of these
transactions, goods are being bought
and sold with the use of money. In
some of these transactions, services
are being exchanged with money.  For
some, there might not be any actual
transfer of money taking place now
but a promise to pay money later.

Have you ever wondered why
transactions  are  made  in
money? The reason is simple. A
person  holding  money  can  easily
exchange  it  for  any  commodity  or
service that he or she might want.
Thus  everyone    prefers  to  receive
payments  in  money  and  then
exchange the money for things that
they want.  Take the case of a shoe
manufacturer. He wants to sell shoes
in the market and buy wheat.  The
shoe manufacturer will first exchange
shoes  that  he  has  produced  for
money, and then exchange the money
for wheat. Imagine how much more

difficult  it  would  be  if  the  shoe
manufacturer  had  to  directly
exchange shoes for wheat without the
use of money. He would have to look
for a wheat growing farmer who not
only wants to sell wheat
but also wants to buy the
shoes
in  exchange.
That  is,  both  parties
have to agree to

I’LL  GIVE
YOU  SHOES
FOR YOUR
WHEAT.

others  commodities.

desires to sell is exactly what the
other wishes to buy. In a barter
system  where  goods  are  directly
exchanged without the use of money,
double  coincidence  of  wants  is  an
essential feature.

In contrast, in an economy where
money is in use, money by providing
the  crucial  intermediate  step
eliminates  the  need  for  double
coincidence of wants. It is no longer
necessary for the shoe manufacturer
to look for a farmer who will buy his
shoes and at the same time sell him

CLOTHES.

I WANT SHOES.
BUT I DON’T HAVE

LET’S  WORK  THESE  OUT

1. How does the use of money make it easier to exchange things?

2. Can you think of some examples of goods / services being exchanged or wages being

paid through barter?

MODERN FORMS OF  MONEY

We  have  se en  that  money  is
something that can act as a medium
of exchange in transactions.  Before
the introduction of coins, a variety of
objects  was  used  as  money.  For
example, since the very early ages,
Indians  used    grains  and  cattle  as
money. Thereafter came the use of
metallic coins — gold, silver, copper
coins — a phase which continued well
into the last century.

Currency

Modern  forms  of  money  include
currency — paper notes and coins.
Unlike the things that were used as
money earlier, modern currency is not
made of precious metal such as gold,
silver and copper.  And unlike grain
and  cattle,  they  are  neither  of
everyday use. The modern currency
is without any use of its own.

Then,  why  is  it  accepted  as  a
medium of exchange?  It is accepted
as a medium of exchange because the
currency  is  authorised  by  the
government of the country.

In India, the Reserve Bank of India
issues currency notes on behalf of the
central  government.  As  per  Indian
individual  or
law,  no  other

organisation  is  allowed  to  issue
currency. Moreover, the law legalises
the  use  of  rupee  as  a  medium  of
payment that cannot be refused in
settling  transactions  in  India.  No
individual in India can legally refuse
a payment made in rupees. Hence,
the  rupee  is  widely  accepted  as  a
medium of exchange.

Deposits with Banks

The other form in which people hold
money is as deposits with banks. At
a point of time, people need only some
currency  for their day-to-day needs.
For instance, workers who receive
their salaries at the end of each month
have extra cash at the beginning of
the month. What do people do with
this extra cash? They deposit it with
the  banks  by  opening  a  bank
account in their name. Banks accept
the deposits and also pay an amount
as interest on the deposits. In this way
people’s  money  is  safe  with  the
banks  and  it  earns  an  amount  as
interest.    People  also  have  the
provision to withdraw the money as
and  when  they  require.  Since  the
deposits in the bank accounts can be
withdrawn  on  demand,  these
deposits are called demand deposits.

For payment through cheque, the
payer who has an account with the
bank,  makes  out  a  cheque  for  a
specific  amount.  A  cheque  is  a
paper instructing the bank to pay

A shoe manufacturer, M. Salim has to make a payment to the leather supplier and writes
a cheque for a specific amount. This means that the shoe manufacturer instructs his
bank to pay this amount to the leather supplier. The leather supplier takes this cheque,
and  deposits it in his own account in the bank. The money is transferred from one bank
account to another bank account in a couple of days. The transaction is complete without
any payment of cash.

Thus we see that demand deposits
share the essential features of money.
The facility of cheques against demand
deposits makes it possible to directly
settle payments without the use of cash.
Since demand deposits are accepted
widely as a means of payment, along
with currency, they constitute money
in the modern economy.

You must remember the role that
the  banks  play  here.  But  for  the
banks,  there  would  be  no  demand
deposits  and  no  payments  by
cheques against these deposits.  The
modern forms of money — currency
and deposits — are closely linked to
the working of the modern banking
system.

1. M. Salim wants to withdraw Rs 20,000 in cash for making payments. How would he

write a cheque to withdraw money?

2. Tick  the  correct  answer.

After  the  transaction  between  Salim  and  Prem,
(i) Salim’s balance in his bank account increases, and Prem’s balance increases.
(ii) Salim’s balance in his bank account decreases and Prem’s balance increases.
(iii) Salim’s balance in his bank account increases and Prem’s balance decreases.

3.  Why  are  demand  deposits  considered  as  money?

LOAN  ACTIVITIES  OF  BANKS

Let us take the story of banks further.
What  do  the  banks  do  with  the
deposits which they accept from the
public?  There  is  an  interesting
mechanism at work here. Banks keep
only  a  small  proportion  of  their
deposits as cash with themselves.  For
example, banks in India these days
hold  about  15  per  cent  of  their
deposits  as  cash.  This  is  kept  as
provision to pay the depositors who
might come to withdraw money from
the bank on any given day. Since, on
any particular day, only some of its
many depositors come to withdraw
cash, the bank is able to manage with
this cash.

Banks use the major portion of the
deposits to extend loans.  There is a

huge demand for loans for various
economic activities. We shall read more
about this in the following sections.
Banks make use of the deposits to
meet  the  loan  requirements  of  the
people.  In this way, banks mediate
between  those  who  have  surplus
funds (the depositors) and those who
are  in  need  of  these  funds  (the
borrowers). Banks charge a higher
interest rate on loans than what they
offer  on  deposits.  The  difference
between  what  is  charged  from
borrowers  and  what  is  paid  to
depositors  is  their  main  source  of
income.

What do you think would happen
if all the depositors went to ask
for their money at the same time?

TWO  DIFFERENT  CREDIT  SITUATIONS

A large number of transactions in our day-to-day activities
involve credit in some form or the other. Credit (loan) refers to
an agreement in which the lender supplies the borrower with
money, goods or services in return for the promise of future
payment. Let us see how credit works through the following
two examples.

(1)  Festival  Season
(1)  Festival  Season
(1)  Festival  Season
(1)  Festival  Season
(1)  Festival  Season
It is festival season two months from now
and the shoe manufacturer, Salim, has
received an order from a large trader in
town for 3,000 pairs of shoes to be
delivered in a month time. To complete
production on time, Salim has to hire a few
more workers for stitching and pasting
work. He has to purchase the raw
materials. To meet these expenses, Salim
obtains loans from two sources. First, he
asks the leather supplier to supply leather

now and promises to pay him later.
Second, he obtains loan in cash from the
large trader as advance payment for
1000 pairs of shoes with a promise to
deliver the whole order by the end of the
month.

At the end of the month, Salim is able to
deliver the order, make a good profit, and
repay the money that he had borrowed.

In this case, Salim obtains credit to meet the working
capital needs of production. The credit helps him to meet the
ongoing expenses of production, complete production on time,

(2)  Swapna’s  Problem

Swapna, a small farmer, grows groundnut on her three
acres of land. She takes a loan from the moneylender
to meet the expenses of cultivation, hoping that her
harvest would help repay the loan. Midway through
the season the crop is hit by pests and the crop
fails. Though Swapna sprays  her crops with
expensive pesticides, it makes little difference. She
is unable to repay the moneylender and the debt
grows over the year into a large amount. Next
year, Swapna takes a fresh loan for cultivation.
It is a normal crop this year. But the earnings
are not enough to cover the old loan.
She is caught in debt. She has to sell
a part of the land to pay off the debt.

In rural areas, the main demand
for credit is for crop production. Crop
production  involves  considerable
costs on seeds, fertilisers, pesticides,
water, electricity, repair of equipment,
etc. There is a minimum stretch of
three to four months between the time
when the farmers buy these inputs
and when they sell the crop. Farmers
usually  take  crop  loans  at  the
beginning of the season and repay the
loan after harvest. Repayment of the
loan  is  crucially  dependent  on  the
income from farming.

LET’S  WORK  THESE  OUT

1. Fill the following table.

Salim

Why  did  they  need  credit?

What  was  the  risk?

What  was  the  outcome?

2. Supposing  Salim  continues  to  get  orders  from  traders.  What  would  be

his position after 6 years?

3. What  are  the  reasons  that  make  Swapna’s  situation  so  risky?  Discuss

factors  –  pesticides;  role  of  moneylenders;  climate.

TERMS  OF  CREDIT

Every  loan  agreement  specifies  an
interest rate which the borrower must
pay  to  the  lender  along  with  the

In Swapna’s case, the failure of the
crop  made
loan  repayment
impossible. She had to sell part of the
land to repay the loan. Credit, instead
of  helping  Swapna  improve  her
earnings, left her worse off. This is an
example of what is commonly called

In one situation credit helps to
increase earnings and therefore the
person is better off than before. In
another  situation,  because  of  the
crop  failure,  credit
pushes the person into
a  debt  trap.  To  repay
her loan she has to sell
a portion of her land.
She  is  clearly  much
worse off than before.

Example of a Village

Rohit and Ranjan had finished reading about the terms of credit in class.
They were eager to know the various credit arrangements that existed in
their area: who were the people who provided credit? Who were the
borrowers? What were the terms of credit? They decided to talk to some
people in their village.  Read what they record...

15th Nov, 2019.

We head directly for the fields where most farmers and
labourers would be working at this time of the day. The fields
are planted with potato crops. We first meet Shyamal, a small
farmer in Sonpur, a small irrigated village.

SSSSShyamal tells us that every season he needs
loans for cultivation on his 1.5 acres of land. Till
a few years back, he would borrow money from
the village moneylender at an interest rate of
five  per  cent  per  month  (60%  per  annum).
For  the  last  few  years,  Shyamal  has  been
borrowing  from  an  agricultural  trader  in  the
village  at  an  interest  rate  of  three  per  cent
per  month.  At  the  beginning  of  the  cropping
season, the trader supplies the farm inputs on
credit, which is  to be repaid when the crops
are ready for harvest.

Besides the interest charge on the loan, the
trader also makes the farmers promise to
sell  the  crop  to  him.  This  way  the  trader
can  ensure  that  the  money  is  repaid
promptly. Also, since the crop prices are low
after  the  harvest,  the  trader  is  able  to
make a profit from buying the crop at a low
price  from  the  farmers  and  then  selling  it
later when the price has risen.

WWWWWe  next  meet  Arun  who  is  supervising  the
work  of  one  farm  labourer.  Arun  has  seven
acres of land. He is one of the few persons
in  Sonpur  to  receive  bank  loan  for
cultivation.  The  interest  rate  on  the    loan
is 8.5 per cent per annum, and can be repaid
anytime in the next three years.  Arun plans
to repay the loan after harvest by selling a
part of the crop. He then intends to store
the rest of the potatoes in a cold storage
and    apply  for  a  fresh  loan  from  the  bank
against the cold storage receipt. The bank
offers  this  facility  to  farmers  who  have
taken crop loan from them.

RRRRRama is working in a neighbouring field. She
works as an agricultural labourer. There are
several months in the year when Rama has
no work, and needs credit to meet the daily
expenses. Expenses on sudden illnesses or
functions in the family are also met through
loans. Rama has to depend on her employer,
a medium landowner in Sonpur, for credit.
The landowner charges an interest rate of
5 per cent per month. Rama repays the
money by working for the landowner. Most
of the time, Rama has to take a fresh loan,
before the previous loan has been repaid.
At  present,  she  owes  the  landowner
Rs 5,000. Though the landowner doesn’t
treat her well, she continues to work for him
since she can get loans from him when in
need. Rama tells us that the only source of
credit for the landless people in Sonpur are
the landowner-employers.

Loans  from  Cooperatives
Besides banks, the other major source of cheap credit
in rural areas are the cooperative societies (or
cooperatives).  Members of a cooperative pool their
resources for cooperation in certain areas. There are
several types of cooperatives possible such as
farmers cooperatives, weavers cooperatives,
industrial workers cooperatives, etc. Krishak
Cooperative functions in a village not very far away
from Sonpur. It has 2300 farmers as members. It
accepts deposits from its members. With these
deposits as collateral, the Cooperative has obtained
a large loan from the bank. These funds are used to
provide loans to members. Once these loans are
repaid, another round of lending can take place.

Krishak Cooperative provides loans for the purchase
of agricultural implements, loans for cultivation
and agricultural trade, fishery loans, loans for
construction of houses and for a variety of other
expenses.

LET’S  WORK  THESE  OUT

1. List the various sources of credit in Sonpur.

2. Underline the various uses of credit in Sonpur in the above passages.

3. Compare the terms of credit for the small farmer, the medium farmer and the landless

agricultural worker in Sonpur.

4. Why will Arun have a higher income from cultivation compared to Shyamal?

5. Can everyone in Sonpur get credit at a cheap rate? Who are the people who can?

6. Tick  the  correct  answer.

(i) Over the years, Rama’s debt

· will  rise.
· will  remain  constant.
· will  decline.

(ii) Arun is one of the few people in Sonpur to take a bank loan because

· other people in the village prefer to borrow from the moneylenders.
· banks demand collateral which everyone cannot provide.
· interest rate on bank loans is same as the interest rate charged by

the  traders.

7. Talk to some people to find out the credit arrangements that exist in your area. Record

your conversation. Note the differences in the terms of credit across people.

informal sector?

Landlords  1%

The  Reserve  Bank  of  India
supervises the functioning of formal
sources of loans.  For instance, we
have seen that the banks maintain a
minimum  cash  balance  out  of  the
deposits  they  receive.  The  RBI
monitors  the  banks  in  actually
maintaining cash balance. Similarly,

the  RBI  sees  that  the  banks  give
loans  not  just  to  profit-making
businesses and traders but also to
small  cultivators,  small  scale
industries,  to  small  borrowers  etc.
Periodically,  banks  have  to  submit
information to the RBI on how much
they are lending, to whom, at what
interest rate, etc.

There  is  no  organisation  which
supervises  the  credit  activities  of
lenders in the informal sector. They
can lend at whatever interest rate they

Formal and Informal Credit:
Who gets what?

Graph  2  shows  the  importance  of
formal and informal sources of credit
for people in urban areas.  The people
are  divided  into  four  groups,  from
poor to rich, as shown in the figure.
You can see that 85 per cent of the
loans taken by poor households in the
urban  areas  are  from  informal
sources. Compare this with the rich
urban  households.  What  do  you
find? Only 10 per cent of their loans
are from informal sources, while 90
per cent are from formal sources. A
similar pattern is also found in rural
areas.  The  rich  households  are
availing  cheap  credit  from  formal
lenders whereas the poor households
have  to  pay  a  large  amount  for
borrowing.

What does all this suggest? First,
the formal sector still meets only about
half of the total credit needs of the
rural  people.  The  remaining  credit
needs are met from informal sources.

choose. There is no one to stop them
from using unfair means to get their
money back.

Compared to the formal lenders,
most of the informal lenders charge a
much higher interest on loans. Thus,
the cost to the borrower of informal
loans is much higher.

Higher cost of borrowing means a
larger  part  of  the  earnings  of  the
borrowers is used to repay the loan.
Hence, borrowers have less income
left  for  themselves  (as  we  saw  for
Shyamal  in  Sonpur).  In  certain
cases,  the  high  interest  rate  for
borrowing can mean that the amount
to  be  repaid  is  greater  than  the
income of the borrower. This could
lead to increasing debt (as we saw for
Rama in Sonpur) and debt trap. Also,
people who might wish to start an
enterprise by borrowing may not do
so  because  of  the  high  cost  of
borrowing.

For  these  reasons,  banks  and
cooperative  societies  need  to  lend
more.  This  would  lead
tohigher
incomes
and many people could
then borrow cheaply for
a variety of needs. They
could  grow  crops,  do
business, set up small-
scale industries etc. They
could set up new indus-
tries  or  trade  in  goods.

households who receive formal credit
whereas the poor have to depend on
the informal sources. It is important
that the formal credit is distributed
more  equally  so  that  the  poor  can
benefit from the cheaper loans.

LET’S  WORK  THESE  OUT

1. What are the differences between formal and informal sources of credit?

2. Why should credit at reasonable rates be available for all?

3. Should there be a supervisor, such as the Reserve Bank of India, that looks into the

loan activities of informal lenders? Why would its task be quite difficult?

4. Why do you think that the share of formal sector credit is higher for the richer households

compared to the poorer households?

SELF-HELP GROUPS FOR THE POOR

In the previous section we have seen
that  poor  households  are  still
dependent  on  informal  sources  of
credit. Why is it so? Banks are not
present  everywhere  in  rural  India.
Even when they are present, getting a
loan  from  a  bank  is  much  more
difficult  than  taking  a  loan  from
informal  sources.  As  we  saw  for
Megha,  bank  loans  require  proper

documents and collateral. Absence
of  collateral  is  one  of  the  major
reasons which prevents the poor from
getting bank loans. Informal lenders
such as moneylenders, on the other
hand, know the borrowers personally
and hence are often willing to give a
loan without collateral. The borrowers
can,  if  necessary,  approach  the
moneylenders even without repaying

to  be  granted  —  the  purpose,
amount,  interest  to  be  charged,
repayment schedule etc.  Also, it is
the  group  which  is  responsible  for
the repayment of the loan. Any case
of non-repayment of loan by any one
member is followed up seriously by
other members in the group. Because
of this feature, banks are willing to
lend  to  the  poor  women  when
organised in SHGs, even though they
have no collateral as such.

Thus,  the  SHGs  help  borrowers
overcome  the  problem  of  lack  of
collateral. They can get timely loans
for  a  variety  of  purposes  and  at  a
reasonable  interest  rate.  Moreover,
SHGs  are  the  building  blocks  of
organisation  of  the  rural  poor.  Not
only does it help women to become
financially  self-reliant,  the  regular
meetings  of  the  group  provide  a
platform  to  discuss  and  act  on  a
variety of social issues such as health,
nutrition, domestic violence, etc.

A women’s self-help group
meeting in Gujarat

their  earlier  loans.  However,  the
moneylenders charge very high rates
of  interest,  keep  no  records  of  the
transactions  and  harass  the  poor
borrowers.

In recent years, people have tried
out  some  newer  ways  of  providing
loans  to  the  poor.  The  idea  is  to
organise  rural  poor,  in  particular
women, into small Self Help Groups
(SHGs)  and  pool  (collect)  their
savings.  A  typical  SHG  has  15-20
members, usually belonging to one
neighbourhood, who meet and save
regularly. Saving per member varies
from  Rs  25  to  Rs  100  or  more,
depending on the ability of the people
to save. Members can take small loans
from  the  group  itself  to  meet  their
needs. The group charges interest on
these loans but this is still less than
what the moneylender charges. After
a year or two, if the group is regular
in  savings,  it  becomes  eligible  for
availing loan from the bank.
Loan  is  sanctioned  in  the
name  of  the  group  and  is
meant  to  create  self-
employment  opportunities
for  the  members.  For
instance,  small  loans  are
provided to the members for
releasing  mortgaged  land,
for meeting working capital
needs  (e.g.  buying  seeds,
fertilisers,  raw  materials
like bamboo and cloth), for
housing  materials,  for
acquiring assets like sewing
machine, handlooms, cattle,
etc.

Most  of  the  important
decisions  regarding  the
savings and loan activities
are  taken  by  the  group
members.  The  group
decides as regards the loans

Grameen  Bank  of  Bangladesh
Grameen  Bank  of  Bangladesh
Grameen  Bank  of  Bangladesh

Grameen Bank of Bangladesh is one of the
biggest success stories in reaching the poor to
meet their credit needs at reasonable rates.
Started in the 1970s as a small project,
Grameen Bank in 2018 had over 9 million
members in about 81,600 villages spread
across Bangladesh. Almost all of the borrowers
are women and belong to poorest sections of
the society. These borrowers have proved that
not only are poor women reliable borrowers, but
that they can start and run a variety of small
income-generating activities successfully.

“If credit can be made available to
the  poor  people  on  terms  and
conditions that are appropriate and
reasonable  these  millions  of  small
people  with  their  millions  of  small
pursuits  can  add  up  to  create  the
biggest development wonder.”

Professor Muhammad Yunus,
the founder of Grameen Bank,
and recipient of 2006 Nobel Prize for Peace

SUMMING  UP

In this chapter we have looked at the
modern forms of money and how they
are linked with the banking system.
On one side are the depositors who
keep their money in the banks and on
the other side are the borrowers who
take loans from these banks. Economic
activities require loans or credit. Credit,
as we saw can have a positive impact,
or  in  certain  situations  make  the
borrower worse off.

Credit is available from a variety of
sources. These can be either formal
sources or informal sources. Terms of

credit  vary  substantially  between
formal  and  informal  lenders.  At
present, it is the richer households
who receive credit from formal sources
whereas the poor have to depend on
the informal sources. It is essential
that  the  total  formal  sector  credit
increases so that the dependence on
the more expensive informal credit
becomes less. Also, the poor should
get a much greater share of formal
loans  from  banks,  cooperative
societies  etc.  Both  these  steps  are
important for development.

EXERCISES

1.

In  situations  with  high  risks,  credit  might  create  further  problems  for  the  borrower.
Explain.

2. How does money solve the problem of double coincidence of wants? Explain with

an example of your own.

3. How  do  banks  mediate  between  those  who  have  surplus  money  and  those  who

need money?

4. Look at a 10 rupee note. What is written on top? Can you explain this statement?
5. Why do we need to expand formal sources of credit in India?
6. What is the basic idea behind the SHGs for the poor? Explain in your own words.
7. What are the reasons why the banks might not be willing to lend to certain borrowers?

CHAPTER 4 : GLOBALISATION AND THE INDIAN ECONOMY

Most regions of the world are getting increasingly
interconnected. While this interconnectedness
across  countries  has  many  dimensions  —
cultural, political, social and economic — this
chapter looks at globalisation in a more limited
sense. It defines globalisation as the integration
between  countries  through  foreign  trade  and
foreign  investments  by  multinational
corporations (MNCs). As you will notice, the more
complex issues of portfolio investment have been
left out.

If we look at the past thirty years or so, we
find that MNCs have been a major force in the
globalisation process connecting distant regions
of the world. Why are the MNCs spreading their
production to other countries and what are the
ways in which they are doing so? The first part
of  the  chapter  discusses  this.  Rather  than
relying on quantitative estimates, the rapid rise
and  influence  of  the  MNCs  has  been  shown
through a variety of examples, mainly drawn
from the Indian context. Note that the examples
are an aid to explain a more general point. While
teaching, the emphasis should be on the ideas
and examples are to be used as illustrations.
You  can  also  creatively  use  comprehension
passages like the one given after Section II to
test and reinforce new concepts.

Integration of production and integration of
markets is a key idea behind understanding the
process of globalisation and its impact. This has
been  dealt  with  at  length  in  this  chapter,
highlighting the role of MNCs in the process.  You
have to ensure that the students grasp this idea
with sufficient clarity, before moving on to the
next topic.

Globalisation has been facilitated by several
factors. Three of these have been highlighted:
rapid improvements in technology, liberalisation

of trade and investment policies and, pressures
from  international  organisations  such  as  the
WTO. Improvement in technology is a fascinating
area  for  students  and  you  may,  with  a  few
directions,  encourage  them  to  do  their  own
explorations. While discussing liberalisation, you
have  to  keep  in  mind  that  the  students  are
unaware  of  what  India  was  like  in  the
pre-liberalisation  era.  A  role-play  could  be
conceived to compare and contrast the pre and
post-liberalisation era. Similarly, international
negotiations  under  WTO  and  the  uneven
balances in power are interesting subjects that
can be covered in a discussion mode rather than
as lectures.

The  final  section  covers  the  impact  of
globalisation. To what extent has globalisation
contributed to the development process? This
section draws on the topics covered in Chapters
1 and 2 (for example, what is a fair development
goal), which you can refer to. Also, examples and
activities drawn from the local environment are
a must while discussing this section. This might
include contexts that have not been covered in
the chapter, such as the impact of imports on
local  farmers,  etc.  Collective  brainstorming
sessions  can  be  conducted  to  analyse  such
situations.

Sources for Information

The call for a fairer globalisation has been given,
among  others,  by  the  International  Labour
Organisation — www.ilo.org. Another interesting
resource is the WTO website http://www.wto.org.
It gives access to the variety of agreements that
are being negotiated at the WTO.  For company
related information, most MNCs have their own
websites.    If  you  want  to  critically  look  at
the  MNCs,  one  recommended  website  is
www.corporatewatch.org.uk.

As consumers in today’s world, some
of us have a wide choice of goods and
services before us. The latest models
of digital cameras, mobile phones and
televisions  made  by  the  leading
manufacturers of the world are within
our reach. Every season, new models
of automobiles can be seen on Indian
roads.  Gone  are  the  days  when
Ambassador and Fiat were the only
cars on  Indian roads. Today, Indians
are buying cars produced by nearly
all the top companies in the world. A
similar explosion of brands can be
seen for many other goods: from shirts
to televisions to processed fruit juices.

Such wide-ranging choice of goods
in our markets is a relatively recent
phenomenon.  You  wouldn’t  have
found such a wide variety of goods in
Indian  markets  even  two  decades

We shall dwell on these questions in
this chapter.

PRODUCTION  ACROSS  COUNTRIES

Until  the  middle  of  the  twentieth
century,  production  was  largely
organised  within  countries.    What
crossed  the  boundaries  of  these
countries were raw material, food stuff
and finished products. Colonies such
as India exported raw materials and
food  stuff  and  imported  finished
goods. Trade was the main channel
connecting distant countries. This was
before  large  companies  called

multinational  corporations
multinational  corporations
multinational  corporations  (MNCs)
multinational  corporations
multinational  corporations
emerged on the scene. A MNC is a
company  that  owns  or  controls
production in more than one nation.
MNCs set up offices and factories for
production in regions where they can
get cheap labour and other resources.
This  is  done  so  that  the  cost  of
production is low and the MNCs can
earn  greater  profits.  Consider  the
following example.

A large MNC, producing industrial equipment, designs its
products in research centres in the United States, and then
has the components manufactured in China. These are then
shipped to Mexico and Eastern Europe where the products
are assembled and the finished products are sold all over the
world. Meanwhile, the company’s customer care is carried out
through call centres located in India.

This is a call centre in Bengaluru, equipped with telecom facilities and access to the
Internet to provide information and support to customers abroad.

divided into small parts and spread
out  across  the  globe.  In  the  above
example,  China  provides  the
advantage  of  being  a  cheap

highly  skilled  engineers  who  can
understand the technical aspects of
production.  It  also  has  educated
English  speaking  youth  who  can
provide customer care services. And
all this probably can mean 50-60 per
cent  cost-savings  for  the  MNC!
The  advantage  of  spreading  out
production across the borders to the
multinationals  can  be  truly
immense.

LET’S  WORK  THIS  OUT

Complete the following statement to show how the production process in the garment
industry  is  spread  across  countries.

The brand tag says ‘Made in Thailand’ but they are not Thai products. We dissect
the  manufacturing  process  and  look  for  the  best  solution  at  each  step.  We  are
doing  it  globally.  In  making  garments,  the  company  may,  for  example,  get  cotton
fibre  from  Korea,  ........

INTERLINKING  PRODUCTION  ACROSS
COUNTRIES

At times, MNCs set up production
jointly  with  some  of  the  local
companies  of  these  countries.  The
benefit to the local company of such
joint  production  is  two-fold.  First,
MNCs  can  provide  money  for
additional investments, like buying
new machines for faster production.
Second, MNCs might bring with them
the latest technology for production.

WE WILL SHIFT
THIS FACTORY TO
ANOTHER COUNTRY.
IT HAS BECOME
EXPENSIVE  HERE!

In general, MNCs set up production
where  it  is  close  to  the  markets;
where there is skilled and unskilled
labour  available  at  low  costs;  and
where the availability of other factors
of production is assured. In addition,
MNCs  might  look  for  government
policies that look after their interests.
You will read more about the policies
later in the chapter.

Having assured themselves of these
conditions, MNCs set up factories and
offices for production. The money that
is spent to buy assets such as land,

But the most common route for
MNC investments is to buy up local
companies  and  then  to  expand
production. MNCs with huge wealth
can  quite  easily  do  so.  To  take  an
example, Cargill Foods, a very large
American MNC, has bought over
smaller Indian companies such as
Parakh Foods. Parakh Foods had
built a large marketing network in
various parts of India, where its brand
was well-reputed. Also, Parakh Foods
had four oil refineries, whose control
has now shifted to Cargill. Cargill is
now the largest producer of edible oil
in India, with a capacity to make 5
million pouches daily!

In  fact,  many  of  the  top  MNCs
have  wealth  exceeding  the  entire
budgets  of  the  developing  country
governments. With such enormous
wealth,  imagine  the  power  and
influence of these MNCs!

There’s  another  way  in  which
MNCs  control  production.  Large
MNCs in developed countries place
orders  for  production  with  small
producers.  Garments,  footwear,
sports  items  are  examples  of
industries  where  production  is
carried  out  by  a  large  number  of
small producers around the world.

Women at home in Ludhiana making footballs for large MNCs

Jeans produced in developing countries being
sold in USA for Rs 6500 ($145)

The  products  are  supplied  to  the
MNCs, which then sell these under
their  own  brand  names  to  the
customers. These large MNCs have
tremendous power to determine price,
quality,  delivery,  and  labour
conditions
for  these  distant
producers.

Thus,  we  see  that  there  are  a
variety of ways in which the MNCs are
spreading  their  production  and
interacting  with  local  producers  in
various countries across the globe. By
setting  up  partnerships  with  local
companies,  by  using  the  local
companies  for  supplies,  by  closely
competing with the local companies
or buying them up, MNCs are exerting
a  strong  influence  on  production
at  these  distant  locations.  As  a

LET’S  WORK  THESE  OUT

Ford Motors, an American
company, is one of the
world’s largest automobile
manufacturers with
production spread over
26 countries of the world.
Ford Motors came to India
in 1995 and spent Rs.
1700 crore to set up a
large plant near Chennai.
This was done in
collaboration with
Mahindra and Mahindra,
a major Indian
manufacturer of jeeps and
trucks. By the year 2017,
Ford Motors was selling
88,000 cars in the Indian
markets,
while another 1,81,000
cars were exported from
India to South Africa,
Mexico, Brazil and United
States of America. The
company wants to develop
Ford India as a
component supplying
base for its other plants
across the globe.

Read the passage on the left and answer the questions.

1. Would  you  say  Ford  Motors  is  a  MNC?  Why?

2. What is foreign investment? How much did Ford Motors invest in India?

3. By  setting  up  their  production  plants  in  India,  MNCs  such  as  Ford
Motors tap the advantage not only of the large markets that countries
such as India provide, but also the lower costs of production. Explain
the  statement.

4. Why do you think the company wants to develop India as a base for
manufacturing car components for its global operations? Discuss the
following  factors:

(a) cost of labour and other resources in India
(b) the  presence  of  several  local  manufacturers  who  supply  auto-

parts  to  Ford  Motors

(c) closeness to a large number of buyers in India and China

5.

In what ways will the production of cars by Ford Motors in India lead to
interlinking of production?

6.

In what ways is a MNC different from other companies?

7. Nearly all major multinationals are American, Japanese or European,
such as Nike, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Honda, Nokia. Can you guess why?

Cars made by Indian workers being
transported to be sold abroad by MNCs.

FOREIGN  TRADE  AND  INTEGRATION  OF
MARKETS

For  a  long  time  foreign  trade  has
been the main channel connecting
countries. In history you would have
read  about  the  trade  routes
connecting India and South Asia to
markets both in the East and West
and the extensive trade that took place
along these routes. Also, you would
remember  that  it  was  trading
interests  which  attracted  various
trading companies such as the East
India Company to India. What then
is  the  basic  function  of  foreign
trade?
116116116116116

To  put  it  simply,  foreign  trade
creates  an  opportunity  for  the
producers  to  reach  beyond  the
domestic markets, i.e., markets of their
own countries. Producers can sell their
produce not only in markets located
within  the  country  but  can  also
compete in markets located in other
countries of the world. Similarly, for
the buyers, import of goods produced
in  another  country  is  one  way  of
expanding  the  choice  of  goods
beyond  what  is  domestically
produced.

Let us see the effect of foreign trade
through the example of Chinese toys
in the Indian markets.

Chinese  Toys  in  India
Chinese  Toys  in  India
Chinese  Toys  in  India
Chinese  Toys  in  India
Chinese  Toys  in  India

Chinese manufacturers learn of
an  opportunity to export toys to
India, where toys are sold at a
high price. They start exporting
plastic toys to India. Buyers in
India now have the option of
choosing between Indian and
the Chinese toys. Because of the
cheaper  prices  and  new
designs, Chinese toys become
more popular in the Indian
markets. Within a year, 70 to 80
per cent of the toy shops have
replaced Indian toys with
Chinese toys. Toys are now
cheaper in the Indian markets
than earlier.

What is happening here? As a
result of trade, Chinese toys
come into the Indian markets.
In the competition between
Indian and Chinese toys,
Chinese toys prove better.
Indian buyers have a greater
choice of toys and at lower
prices. For the Chinese toy
makers, this provides an
opportunity to expand business.
The opposite is true for Indian
toy makers. They face losses, as
their  toys  are  selling
much less.

In  general,  with  the  opening  of
trade, goods travel from one market
to  another.  Choice  of  goods  in  the
markets  rises.  Prices  of  similar
goods  in  the  two  markets  tend  to
become equal. And, producers in the
two countries now closely compete
against each other even though they
are separated by thousands of miles!

Small traders of readymade garments facing stiff
competition from both the MNC brands and imports.

LET’S  WORK  THESE  OUT

1. What  was  the  main  channel  connecting  countries  in  the  past?  How  is  it  different

now?

2. Distinguish between foreign trade and foreign investment.

3.

In recent years China has been importing steel from India. Explain how the import
of steel by China will affect.

(a) steel  companies  in  China.
(b) steel  companies  in  India.
(c) industries buying steel for production of other industrial goods in China.

4. How will the import of steel from India into the Chinese markets lead to integration

of markets for steel in the two countries? Explain.

WHAT  IS  GLOBALISATION?

In  the  past  two  to  three  decades,
more  and  more  MNCs  have  been
looking  for  locations  around  the
world which would be cheap for their
production.  Foreign  investment  by
MNCs  in  these  countries  has  been
rising.    At  the  same  time,  foreign
trade  between  countries  has  been
rising  rapidly.  A  large  part  of  the
foreign  trade  is  also  controlled  by
MNCs.  For  instance,  the  car
manufacturing plant of Ford Motors
in India not only produces cars for the
Indian markets, it also exports cars
to  other  developing  countries  and
exports car components for its many
factories around the world. Likewise,
activities  of  most  MNCs  involve
substantial trade in goods and also
services.

investments

Besides the movements of goods,
services,
and
technology,  there  is  one  more  way
in  which  the  countries  can  be
connected.  This  is  through  the
movement  of  people  between
countries. People usually move from
one country to another in search of
better income, better jobs or better
education. In the past few decades,
however, there has not been much
increase in the movement of people
between  countries  due  to  various
restrictions.

...WE’VE SEEN GREAT IMPROVEMENTS
IN  TRANSPORTATION...

FACTORS  THAT  HAVE  ENABLED  GLOBALISATION

Technology

Rapid  improvement  in  technology  has  been  one  major  factor  that  has
stimulated the globalisation process. For instance, the past fifty years have
seen  several  improvements  in  transportation  technology.  This  has  made
much faster delivery of goods across long distances possible at lower costs.

Containers for
transport of goods
Goods are placed in containers that
can be loaded intact onto ships,
railways, planes and trucks.
Containers have led to huge
reduction in port handling costs
and increased the speed with which
exports  can  reach  markets.
Similarly, the cost of air transport
has fallen.  This has enabled much
greater volumes of goods being
transported by airlines.

Liberalisation of foreign trade
and foreign investment policy

Let us return to the example of imports
of Chinese toys in India. Suppose the
Indian  government  puts  a  tax  on
import of toys. What would happen?
Those who wish to import these toys
would have to pay tax on this. Because
of the tax, buyers will have to pay a
higher  price  on  imported  toys.
Chinese  toys  will  no  longer  be  as
cheap    in  the  Indian  markets  and
imports from China will automatically
reduce.  Indian  toy-makers  will
prosper.

Tax  on  imports  is  an  example  of
trade  barrier
trade  barrier
trade  barrier.  It  is  called  a  barrier
trade  barrier
trade  barrier
because  some  restriction  has  been
set up. Governments can use trade
barriers  to  increase  or  decrease
(regulate) foreign trade and to decide
what kinds of goods and how much
of  each,  should  come  into  the
country.

The  Indian  government,  after
Independence,  had  put  barriers  to
foreign trade and foreign investment.
This  was  considered  necessary  to
protect  the  producers  within  the
country    from  foreign  competition.
Industries were just coming up in the
1950s  and  1960s,  and  competition
from imports at that stage would not
have  allowed  these  industries  to
come up. Thus, India allowed imports
of  only  essential  items  such  as

LET’S  WORK  THESE  OUT

machinery,  fertilisers,  petroleum
etc.  Note  that  all  developed
countries, during the early stages of
development, have given protection to
domestic producers through a variety
of means.

Starting  around  1991,  some  far-
reaching changes in policy were made
in  India.    The  government  decided
that  the  time  had  come  for  Indian
producers to compete with producers
around  the  globe.  It  felt  that
competition  would  improve  the
performance of producers within the
country  since  they  would  have  to
improve  their  quality.  This  decision
was
supported  by  powerful
international  organisations.

Thus, barriers on foreign trade and
foreign investment were removed to a
large  extent.  This  meant  that  goods
could be imported and exported easily
and also foreign companies could set
up
offices
here.

known  as
liberalisation of trade, businesses are
allowed  to  make  decisions  freely
about  what  they  wish  to  import  or
export.  The  government  imposes
much  less  restrictions  than  before
and  is  therefore  said  to  be  more
liberal.

1. What do you understand by liberalisation of foreign trade?

2. Tax on imports is one type of trade barrier. The government could also place a limit on
the number of goods that can be imported. This is known as quotas.  Can you explain,
using  the  example  of  Chinese  toys,  how  quotas  can  be  used  as  trade  barriers?
Do  you  think  this  should  be  used?  Discuss.

WORLD  TRADE  ORGANISATION

We have seen that the liberalisation
of  foreign  trade  and  investment  in
India  was  supported  by  some  very
powerful international organisations.
These  organisations  say  that  all
barriers  to  foreign  trade  and
investment are harmful. There should
be  no  barriers.  Trade  between
countries  should  be  ‘free’.  All
countries  in  the  world  should
liberalise  their  policies.

World Trade Organisation (WTO) is
one  such  organisation  whose  aim  is
to  liberalise  international  trade.
Started  at  the  initiative  of  the

developed countries, WTO establishes
rules  regarding  international  trade,
and sees that these rules are obeyed.
About 160 countries of the world are
currently members of the WTO.

Though WTO is supposed to allow
free trade for all, in practice, it is seen
that  the  developed  countries  have
unfairly retained trade barriers. On the
other hand, WTO rules have forced the
developing countries to remove trade
barriers.  An  example  of  this  is  the
current  debate  on
in
agricultural products.

Developing countries are, therefore, asking the
developed country governments, “We have
reduced trade barriers as per WTO rules. But you
have ignored the rules of WTO and have continued
to pay your farmers vast sums of money.  You have
asked our governments to stop supporting our

A typical cotton farm in USA consists of thousands of acres owned by
a huge corporation that will sell cotton abroad at lowered prices.

You have seen in Chapter 2, that the
agriculture sector provides the bulk
of employment and a significant
portion of the GDP in India. Compare
this to a developed country such as
the US with the share of agriculture
in GDP at 1%  and its share in total
employment a tiny 0.5%! And yet
this very small percentage of
people who are engaged in
agriculture in the US  receive
massive sums of money from
the  US  government  for
production and for exports to
other countries. Due to this
massive money that they
receive, US farmers can sell the
farm products at abnormally
low prices. The surplus farm
products are sold in other
country markets at low prices,
adversely affecting farmers in
these countries.

of certain types of goods, such as those which are environmentally friendly. Discuss
whether these are fair or not.

IMPACT  OF  GLOBALISATION  IN  INDIA

In the last twenty years, globalisation
of  the  Indian  economy  has  come  a
long way. What has been its effect on
the  lives  of  people?  Let  us  look  at
some of the evidence.

Globalisation  and  greater
competition among producers - both
local  and  foreign  producers  -  has
been  of  advantage  to  consumers,
particularly  the  well-off  sections  in
the  urban  areas.  There  is  greater
choice before these consumers who
now  enjoy  improved  quality  and
lower prices for several products. As
a  result,  these  people  today,  enjoy
much higher standards of living than
was possible earlier.

Among producers and workers, the
impact  of  globalisation  has  not  been
uniform.

MNCs
MNCs
Firstly, MNCs
MNCs have increased their
MNCs
investments in India over the past 20
years, which means investing in India
has  been  beneficial  for  them.  MNCs
have  been  interested  in  industries
such  as  cell  phones,  automobiles,
electronics,  soft  drinks,  fast  food  or
services  such  as  banking  in  urban
areas.  These  products  have  a  large
number  of  well-off    buyers.  In  these
industries and services, new jobs have
been  created.  Also,  local  companies
supplying raw materials, etc. to these
industries have prospered.

Steps  to  Attract  Foreign  Investment
Steps  to  Attract  Foreign  Investment
In recent years, the central and state
governments in India are taking special
steps  to  attract  foreign  companies  to
invest in India. Industrial zones, called
Special  Economic  Zones  (SEZs),  are
being  set  up.  SEZs  are  to  have  world
class facilities: electricity, water, roads,
transport,  storage,  recreational  and
educational  facilities.  Companies  who
set up production units in the SEZs do
not have to pay taxes for an initial period
of five years.

rights. In the recent years, the government
has allowed companies to ignore many of
these.  Instead  of  hiring  workers  on  a
regular  basis,  companies  hire  workers
‘flexibly’ for short periods when there is
intense pressure of work. This is done to
reduce the cost of labour for the company.
However,  still  not  satisfied,  foreign
companies are demanding more flexibility
in labour laws.

NOW, WE
ARE  READY
TO  INVEST!

Government  has  also  allowed

from the increased competition. They
have invested in newer technology and
production  methods  and  raised  their
production  standards.  Some  have
gained from successful collaborations
with foreign companies.

Moreover, globalisation has enabled
some  large  Indian  companies  to
emerge as multinationals themselves!
Tata Motors (auto-mobiles), Infosys (IT),
Ranbaxy  (medicines),  Asian  Paints
(paints),  Sundaram  Fasteners  (nuts
and bolts) are some Indian companies

which  are  spreading  their  operations
worldwide.

Globalisation  has  also  created
new  opportunities  for  companies
providing  services,  particularly  those
involving  IT.  The  Indian  company
producing  a  magazine  for  the  London
based  company  and  call  centres  are
some  examples.    Besides,  a  host  of
services such as data entry, account-ing,
administrative  tasks,  engineering  are
now  being  done  cheaply  in  countries
such  as  India  and  are  exported  to  the
developed  countries.

LET’S  WORK  THESE  OUT

1. How has competition benefited people in India?

2. Should more Indian companies emerge as MNCs? How would it benefit the people in

the  country?

3. Why do governments try to attract more foreign investment?

4.

In Chapter 1, we saw what may be development for one may be destructive for others.
The  setting  of  SEZs  has  been  opposed  by  some  people  in  India.  Find  out  who  are
these people and why are they opposing it.

Small producers: Compete or perish

For a large number of small producers and
workers  globalisation  has  posed  major
challenges.

Rising  Competition
Rising  Competition
Rising  Competition

Rising  Competition

Ravi did not expect that he would have
to face a crisis in such a short period of
his life as industrialist. Ravi took a loan
from the bank to start his own company
producing capacitors in 1992 in Hosur,
an industrial town in Tamil Nadu.
Capacitors are used in many electronic
home appliances including tube lights,
television etc.  Within three years, he was
able to expand production and had 20
workers working under him.
His struggle to run his company started
when  the  government  removed
restrictions on  imports of capacitors as
per its agreement at WTO in 2001. His
main clients, the television companies,
used to buy different components

including capacitors in bulk for the
manufacture of television sets. However,
competition from the MNC brands forced
the Indian television companies to move
into assembling activities for MNCs. Even
when some of them bought capacitors,
they would prefer to import as the price
of the imported item was half the price
charged by people like Ravi.
Ravi now produces less than half the
capacitors that he produced in the year
2000 and has only seven workers
working for him. Many of Ravi’s friends
in the same business in Hyderabad and
Chennai have closed their units.

Batteries,  capacitors,  plastics,  toys,  tyres,  dairy  products,  and
vegetable  oil  are  some  examples  of  industries  where  the  small
manufacturers have been hit hard due to competition. Several of the
units  have  shut  down  rendering  many  workers  jobless.  The  small
industries in India employ the largest number of workers (20 million)
in the country, next only to agriculture.

LET’S  WORK  THESE  OUT

1. What are the ways in which Ravi’s small production unit was affected by rising competition?

2. Should producers such as Ravi stop production because their cost of production is higher compared to

producers in other countries? What do you think?

3. Recent studies point out that small producers in India need three things to compete better in the market
(a) better roads, power, water, raw materials, marketing and information network (b) improvements and
modernisation  of  technology  (c)  timely  availability  of  credit  at  reasonable  interest  rates.

 Can you explain how these three things would help Indian producers?
 Do you think MNCs will be interested in investing in these? Why?
 Do you think the government has a role in making these facilities available? Why?
 Can you think of any other step that the government could take? Discuss.

Competition and Uncertain Employment

  Globalisation  and  the  pressure  of  competition  have  substantially  changed  the
lives of workers. Faced with growing competition, most employers these days prefer
to employ workers ‘flexibly’. This means that workers’ jobs are no longer secure.

Let us see how the workers in the garment export industry
in India are having to bear this pressure of competition.

Factory workers folding garments for export. Though globalisation has created opportunities for paid work for
women, the condition of employment shows that women are denied their fair share of benefits.

Large  MNCs  in  the  garment  industry  in
Europe  and  America  order  their  products
from  Indian  exporters.  These  large  MNCs
with  worldwide  network  look  for  the
cheapest  goods  in  order  to  maximise  their
profits.  To  get  these  large  orders,  Indian
garment exporters try hard to cut their own
costs.  As  cost  of  raw  materials  cannot  be
reduced, exporters try to cut labour costs.
Where  earlier  a  factory  used  to  employ
workers  on  a  permanent  basis,  now  they
employ workers only on a temporary basis
so that they do not have to pay workers for
the whole year. Workers also have to put in
very  long  working  hours  and  work  night
shifts  on  a  regular  basis  during  the  peak
season.  Wages  are  low  and  workers  are
forced to work overtime to make both ends
meet.

While  this  competition  among  the
garment exporters has allowed the MNCs to
make large profits, workers are denied their
fair share of benefits brought about by globalisation.

35 year old Sushila has spent many
years as a worker in garment export
industry of Delhi. She was employed
as a ‘permanent worker’ entitled to
health insurance, provident fund,
overtime at a double rate, when
Sushila’s factory closed in the late
1990s.  After searching for a job  for
six months, she finally got a job  30
km. away from where she lives. Even
after working in this factory for
several years, she is a temporary
worker and earns less than half of
what she was earning earlier. Sushila
leaves her house every morning,
seven days a week at 7:30 a.m. and
returns at 10 p.m.  A day off from work
means no wage. She has none of the
benefits she used to get earlier.
Factories closer to her home have
widely fluctuating orders and
therefore pay even less.

The conditions of work and the hardships of the workers described above
have become common to many industrial units and services in India. Most
workers,  today,  are  employed  in  the  unorganised  sector.  Moreover,
increasingly  conditions  of  work  in  the  organised  sector  have  come  to
resemble the unorganised sector. Workers in the organised sector such as
Sushila no longer get the protection and benefits that they enjoyed earlier.

LET’S  WORK  THESE  OUT

1.

In what ways has competition affected workers, Indian exporters and foreign MNCs
in  the  garment  industry?

2. What can be done by each of the following so that the workers can get a fair share

of benefits brought by globalisation?

(a) government
(b) employers  at  the  exporting  factories
(c) MNCs
(d) workers.

3. One  of  the  present  debates  in  India  is  whether  companies  should  have  flexible
policies for employment. Based on what you have read in the chapter, summarise
the point of view of the employers and workers.

THE STRUGGLE FOR A FAIR GLOBALISATION

The  above  evidence  indicates  that
not  everyone  has  benefited  from
globalisation. People with education,
skill and wealth have made the best
use of the new opportunities. On the
other  hand,  there  are  many  people
who have not shared the benefits.

Since  globalisation  is  now  a
reality,  the  question  is  how  to
make  globalisation  more  ‘fair’?
Fair  globalisation  would  create
opportunities for all, and also ensure
that the benefits of globalisation are
shared better.

ensure that labour laws are properly
implemented and the workers get their
rights. It can support small producers
to  improve  their  performance  till  the
time  they  become  strong  enough  to
compete. If necessary, the government
can use trade and investment barriers.
It can negotiate at the WTO for ‘fairer
rules’.  It  can  also  align  with  other
developing  countries  with  similar
interests  to  fight  against  the
domination of developed countries in
the WTO.

organisations

In  the  past  few  years,  massive
campaigns  and    representation  by
people’s
have
influenced  important  decisions
relating to trade and investments at
the  WTO.  This  has  demonstrated
that people also can play an important
role

in  the  struggle

The government can play a major
role  in  making  this  possible.  Its
policies must protect the interests, not
only of the rich and the powerful, but
all  the  people  in  the  country.  You
have read about some of the possible
steps that the government can take.
For  instance,  the  government  can

A demonstration against WTO in Hong Kong, 2005

SUMMING  UP

In this chapter, we looked at the
present phase of globalisation.
Globalisation is the process of
rapid  integration  of  countries.
This  is  happening  through
greater  foreign  trade  and
foreign  investment.  MNCs  are
playing  a  major  role  in  the
globalisation process. More and
more  MNCs  are  looking  for
locations around the world that
are cheap for their production.
As a result, production is being
organised in complex ways.

Technology,  particularly  IT,
has  played  a  big  role  in
organising  production  across
countries.
In  addition,
liberalisation  of  trade  and

investment  has  facilitated
globalisation  by  removing
barriers to trade and investment.
At the inter-national level, WTO
has put pressure on developing
coun-tries to liberalise trade and
investment.

While  globalisation  has
benefited  well-off  consumers
and  also  producers  with  skill,
education  and  wealth,  many
small  producers  and  workers
have suffered as a result of the
rising  competition.
  Fair
globalisation  would  create
opportunities  for  all,  and  also
ensure  that  the  benefits  of
globalisation are shared better.

EXERCISES

1 What do you understand by globalisation? Explain in your own words.

2. What were the reasons for putting barriers to foreign trade and foreign investment by

the Indian government? Why did it wish to remove these barriers?

3. How would flexibility in labour laws help companies?

4. What are the various ways in which MNCs set up, control or produce in other countries?

5. Why  do  developed  countries  want  developing  countries  to  liberalise  their  trade  and
investment?  What do you think should the developing countries demand in return?

6. “The  impact  of  globalisation  has  not  been  uniform.”  Explain  this  statement.

7. How has liberalisation of trade and investment policies helped the globalisation

process?

8. How does foreign trade lead to integration of markets across countries? Explain

with an example other than those given here.

9. Globalisation will continue in the future. Can you imagine what the world would be

like twenty years from now? Give reasons for your answer.

NOTES FOR THE TEACHER
CHAPTER 5 : CONSUMER RIGHTS

This chapter proposes to discuss the issue of
consumer rights within the context of the ways
markets operate in our country. There are many
aspects of unequal situations in a market and
poor  enforcement  of  rules  and  regulations.
Hence, there is a need to sensitise learners and
encourage them to participate in the consumer
movement. This chapter provides case histories
— how some consumers were exploited  in real
life situation and how legal institutions helped
consumers    in  getting  compensated  and  in
upholding their rights. The case histories would
enable the students to link these narratives to
their  life  experiences.  We  have  to  enable
students to understand that the awareness of
being a well-informed consumer arose out of
consumer movement and active participation of
people  through  their  struggles  over  a  long
period. This chapter also provides details of a
few organisations helping consumers in different
ways. Finally, it ends with some critical issues
of the consumer movement in India.

This chapter has questions, case studies and
activities. It would be preferred that students
discuss these in groups orally. Some of these
could be answered in writing individually.

While carrying out each activity you could
start with a brainstorming session about the
activity. Similarly, there are many opportunities
for roleplay in this chapter and this could be a
useful  way  to  share  their  experiences  and
understand the issues at a deeper level. Making

posters collectively is another way to think about
these  issues.  This  lesson  contains  activities,
which  require  visits  —  visit  to  consumer
protection councils, consumer organisations,
District/State/National  level  Consumer
Disputes Redressal Commissions, retail shops,
marketplaces,  etc.  Organise  the  visits  to
maximise  learners’  experience.    Have  a
discussion with them about the purpose of the
visit,  things  they  need  to  do  beforehand  and
things that need to be collected and the task
(report/ project / article, etc.) they would carry
out after the visit. As part of this chapter, the
learners  may  do  letter-writing  and  speaking
activities. We may have to be sensitive to the
language aspect of exercises.

This  chapter  contains  material  collected
from authenticated websites, books, newspapers
and magazines. For example, https://consumer
affairs.nic.in is a website of Central Government
Ministry  of  Consumer  Affairs,  Food  &  Public
Distribution.  Another  website  www.cuts-
international.org is the website of a consumer
organisation working in India for 40 years. It
publishes  a  variety  of  material  to  create
consumer awareness in India. They need to be
shared among learners so that they can also
collect material as part of their activities. For
example,  case  histories  were  taken  from
newspaper clippings and consumers who fought
in Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions.
Let learners collect and read such material from
different sources: consumer protection councils,
Consumer  Disputes  Redressal  Commissions
and internet.

CONSUMER  RIGHTS

The collage you see below contains
some  news  clippings  of  Consumer
Disputes  Redressal  Commission
verdicts.  Why  did  the  people  go  to
these organisations in these cases?
These verdicts came about because
some people persisted and struggled
to get justice. In what ways were they
denied  justice?  More  importantly,

what are the ways in which they can
exercise their rights as consumers to
get a fair deal from the sellers when
they felt they had been denied a just
treatment?

THE CONSUMER IN THE MARKETPLACE

Likewise,  rules  and  regulations
are required for the protection of the
consumers  in  the  marketplace.
Individual  consumers  often  find
themselves  in  a  weak  position.
Whenever  there  is  a  complaint
regarding a good or service that had
been bought, the seller tries to shift
all the responsibility on to the buyer.
Their  position  usually  is  –  “If  you
didn’t like what you bought, please
go elsewhere”. As if the seller has no
responsibility  once  a  sale  is
completed! The consumer movement,
as we shall discuss later, is an effort
to change this situation.

Exploitation  in  the  marketplace
happens  in  various  ways.  For
example, sometimes traders indulge
in unfair trade practices such as when
shopkeepers  weigh  less  than  what
they  should  or  when  traders  add
charges  that  were  not  mentioned
before, or when adulterated/defective
goods are sold.

Markets  do  not  work  in  a  fair
manner when producers are few and
powerful  whereas  consumers
purchase in small amounts and are
scattered.  This  happens  especially
when large companies are producing
these goods. These companies with
huge wealth, power and reach can
manipulate  the  market  in  various
ways. At times false information is
passed on through the media, and
other sources to attract consumers.
For  example,  a  company  for  years
sold powder milk for babies all over

We participate in the market both as
producers  and  consumers.  As
producers of goods and services we
could be working in any of the sectors
discussed earlier such as agriculture,
industry,  or  services.  Consumers
participate in the market when they
purchase goods and services that they
need. These are the final goods that
people as consumers use.

In  the  preceding  chapters  we
discussed  the  need  for  rules  and
regulations  or  steps  that  would
promote development. These could be
for the protection of workers in the
unorganised  sector  or  to  protect
people  from  high  interest  rates
charged  by  moneylenders    in  the
informal sector. Similarly, rules and
regulations  are  also  required  for
protecting the environment.

For example, moneylenders in the
informal sector that you read about
in Chapter 3 adopt various tricks to
bind the borrower: they could make
the producer sell the produce to them
at a low rate in return for a timely loan;
they could force a small farmer like
Swapna to sell her land to pay back
the loan. Similarly, many people who
work in the unorganised sector have
to  work  at  a  low  wage  and  accept
conditions that are not fair and are
also often harmful to their health. To
prevent  such  exploitation,  we
have talked of rules and regulations
for  their  protection.  There  are
organisations  that  have  struggled
for long to ensure that these rules are
followed.

THEY  PURPOSELY  MADE  IT
SO IT WOULD FALL APART
AFTER A FEW MONTHS SO
THAT I WILL BUY A NEW ONE!

EVERYONE KNOWS
TOBACCO  KILLS  PEOPLE,
BUT WHO CAN SAY THAT
TOBACCO COMPANIES
SHOULD NOT BE FREE
TO SELL TOBACCO?

the  world  as  the  most  scientific
product  claiming  this  to  be  better
than mother’s milk. It took years of
struggle  before  the  company  was
forced  to  accept  that  it  had  been
making  false  claims.  Similarly,  a
long  battle  had  to  be  fought  with
court  cases  to  make  cigarette-
manufacturing companies accept that
their  product  could  cause  cancer.
Hence, there is a need for rules and
regulations to ensure protection for
consumers.

LET’S  WORK  THESE  OUT

1. What are the various ways by which people may be exploited in the market?

2. Think of one example from your experience where you thought that there was some

‘cheating’  in  the  market.  Discuss  in  the  classroom.

3. What do you think should be the role of government to protect consumers?

CONSUMER  MOVEMENT

The consumer movement arose out
of dissatisfaction of the consumers
as many unfair practices were being
indulged in by the sellers. There was
n o   l e g a l   s y s t e m   a v a i l a b l e   t o
consumers  to  protect  them  from
exploitation in the marketplace. For
a long time, when a consumer was
not happy with a particular brand
product or shop, he or she generally
avoided buying that brand product,
or would stop purchasing from that
shop. It was presumed that it was
the responsibility of consumers to be
careful while buying a commodity
or  service.  It  took  many  years  for
organisations in India, and around
the  world,  to  create  awareness
amongst  people.  This  has  also
shifted the responsibility of ensuring

quality  of  goods  and  services  on
the sellers.

In

the

India,

consumer
movement  as  a  ‘social  force’
originated  with  the  necessity  of
protecting  and  promoting  the
interests  of  consumers  against
unethical and unfair trade practices.
Rampant food shortages, hoarding,
black  marketing,  adulteration  of
food and edible oil gave birth to the
in  an
consumer  movement
organised form in the 1960s. Till the
1970s,  consumer  organisations
were  largely  engaged  in  writing
articles  and  holding  exhibitions.
They  formed  consumer  groups  to
look into the malpractices in ration
shops and overcrowding in the road
passenger transport. More recently,
India  witnessed  an  upsurge  in  the
number of consumer groups.

Consumers International

In 1985 United Nations adopted
the UN Guidelines for Consumer
Protection. This was a tool for
nations to adopt measures to
protect consumers and for
consumer advocacy groups to
press their governments to do
so. At the international level, this
has become the foundation for
consumer movement. Today,
Consumers International has
become an umbrella body to
over 200 member organisations
from over 100 countries.

Because  of  all  these  efforts,  the  movement  succeeded
in  bringing  pressure  on  business  firms  as  well  as
government  to  correct  business  conduct  which  may  be
unfair  and  against  the  interests  of  consumers  at  large.  A
major  step  taken  in  1986  by  the  Indian  government  was
the  enactment  of  the  Consumer  Protection  Act  1986,
popularly  known  as  COPRA.  You  will  learn  more  about
COPRA  later.

LET’S  WORK  THESE  OUT

1. What could have been the steps taken by consumer groups?

2. There may be rules and regulations but they are often not followed. Why? Discuss.

SAFETY IS EVERYONE’S RIGHT

Reji’s  Suffering
Reji’s  Suffering
Reji’s  Suffering
Reji’s  Suffering
Reji’s  Suffering

Reji Mathew, a healthy boy studying in Class
IX, was admitted in a private clinic in Kerala
for removal of tonsils. An ENT surgeon
performed the tonsillectomy operation under
general anaesthesia. As a result of improper
anaesthesia Reji showed symptoms of some
brain abnormalities because of which he was
crippled for life.

His father filed a complaint in the State
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission
claiming compensation of Rs 5,00,000 for
medical negligence and deficiency, in
service. The State Commission, saying that
the evidence was not sufficient, dismissed
it. Reji’s father appealed again in the
National Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission located
in New Delhi. The
National Commission
after looking into the
complaint, held the
hospital responsible
for medical negligence
and directed it to pay
the compensation.

Reji’s  suffering  shows  how  a
hospital,  due  to  negligence  by  the
in  giving
doctors  and  staff
anaesthesia, crippled a student for
life.  While  using  many  goods  and
services, we as consumers, have the
right  to  be  protected  against  the
marketing  of  goods  and  delivery  of
services that are hazardous to life and
property. Producers need to strictly
follow the required safety rules and
regulations. There are many goods
and services that we purchase that
require special attention to safety. For
example,  pressure  cookers  have  a
safety valve which, if it is defective, can
cause  a  serious  accident.  The
manufacturers of the safety valve have
to ensure high quality. You also need
public or government action to see
that  this  quality  is  maintained.
However,  we  do  find  bad  quality
products in the market because the
supervision of these rules is weak and
the consumer movement is also not
strong enough.

LET’S  WORK  THESE  OUT

1. For  the  following  (you  can  add  to  the  list)  products/services  discuss  what  safety

rules should be observed by the producer?

(a) LPG cylinder (b) cinema theatre (c) circus (d) medicines (e) edible oil
(f) marriage pandal (g) a high-rise building.

2. Find out any case of accident or negligence from people around you, where you think

that  the  responsibility  lay  with  the  producer.  Discuss.

Information about goods and
services

When you buy any commodity, you
will find certain details given on the
packing.  These  details  are  about
ingredients  used,  price,  batch
number, date of manufacture, expiry
date  and  the  address  of  the
manufacturer.  When  we  buy
medicines, on the packets, you might
find ‘directions for proper use’ and
information relating to side effects and
risks associated with usage of that
medicine. When you buy garments,
you  will  find  information  on
‘instructions for washing’.

Why is it that rules have been made
so that the manufacturer displays this
information? It is because consumers
right to be informed
right to be informed
have the right to be informed
right to be informed about
right to be informed
the particulars of goods and services
that  they  purchase.  Consumers
can  then  complain  and  ask  for
compensation or replacement if the
product proves to be defective in any
manner.  For  example,  if  we  buy  a

product  and  find  it  defective  well
within the expiry period, we can ask
for a replacement. If the expiry period
was not printed, the manufacturer
would blame the shopkeeper and will
not accept the responsibility. If people
sell  medicines  that  have  expired
severe action can be taken against
them. Similarly, one can protest and
complain if someone sells a good at
more than the printed price on the
packet. This is indicated by ‘MRP’ —
maximum  retail  price.  In  fact
consumers can bargain with the seller
to sell at less than the MRP.

In  recent  times,  the  right  to
information  has  been  expanded  to
cover various services provided by the
Government.  In  October  2005,  the
Government of India enacted a law,
popularly  known  as  RTI  (Right  to
Information) Act, which ensures its
citizens all the information about the
functions of government departments.
The  effect  of  the  RTI  Act  can  be
understood from the following case.

Waiting...
Waiting...
Waiting...
Waiting...
Waiting...
Amritha, an engineering graduate
after submitting all the certificates
and attending the interview for a
job in a government department, did
not receive any news of the result.
The officials also refused to comply
with her queries. She therefore filed
an application using the RTI Act
saying that it was her right to know
the result in a reasonable time so
that she could plan her future. She
was  not only informed about the
reasons for delay in the declaration
of results but also got her call letter
for appointment as she performed
well in the interview.

LET’S  WORK  THESE  OUT

1. When we buy commodities we find that the price charged is sometimes higher or
lower  than  the  Maximum  Retail  Price  printed  on  the  pack.    Discuss  the  possible
reasons.  Should  consumer  groups  do  something  about  this?

2. Pick up a few packaged goods that you want to buy and examine the information
given.  In  what  ways  are  they  useful?  Is  there  some  information  that  you  think
should be given on those packaged goods but is not? Discuss.

3. People  make  complaints  about  the  lack  of  civic  amenities  such  as  bad  roads  or
poor water and health facilities but no one listens. Now the RTI Act gives you the
power to question. Do you agree? Discuss.

Abirami, a student of Ansari
Nagar, joined a two-year
course at a local coaching
institute for professional
courses in New Delhi. At the
time of joining the course,
she paid the fees Rs 61,020
as lumpsum for the entire
course  of  two  years.
However, she decided to opt
out of the course at the end of one year
as she found that the quality of
teaching was not up to the mark. When
she asked for a refund of the fee for
one year, it was denied to her.

When she filed the case in the District
Consumer  Disputes  Redressal
Commission, the Commission directed
the Institute to refund Rs 28,000 saying
that she had the right to choose. The

Institute again appealed
in the State Consumer
Com-mission. The State
Commission upheld the
District Commission’s
direction and further
fined  the  institute
Rs 25,000 for a frivolous
appeal. It also directed
the institute to pay
Rs  7000  as  compensation  and
litigation cost.

The State Commission also restrained
all the educational and professional
institutions in the state from charging
fees from students for the entire
duration of the course in advance and
that too at one go. Any violation of this
order may  invite  penalties  and
imprisonment, the commission said.

What do we understand from this
incident? Any consumer who receives a
service in whatever capacity, regardless
of age, gender and nature of service, has
right  to  choose      whether  to
right  to  choose
right  to  choose
the  right  to  choose
right  to  choose
continue to receive the service.

Suppose  you  want  to  buy
toothpaste, and the shop owner says
that she can sell the toothpaste only

if you buy a toothbrush. If you are not
interested in buying the brush, your
right  to  choice  is  denied.  Similarly,
sometimes gas supply dealers insist
that you have to buy the stove from
them when you take a new connection.
In  this  way  many  a  times  you  are
forced to buy things that you may not
wish to and you are left with no choice.

Where should consumers go
to get justice?

Read again the cases of Reji Mathew
and  Abirami  given  earlier  in  the
chapter.

These are some examples in which
consumers are denied their rights.
Such instances occur quite often in
our  country.  Where  should  these
consumers go to get justice?

Consumers have the right to seek

damage is done to a consumer, she

There is a need to provide an easy
and effective public system by which
this can be done.

The  consumer  can

file  a
complaint  before  the  appropriate
consumer  forum  on  his/her  own
with  or  without  the  services  of
lawyers. You might be interested in
knowing  how  an  aggrieved  person
gets his or her compensation. Let us
take the case of Prakash. He had sent
a money-order to his village for his
daughter’s marriage. The money did
not reach his daughter at the time
when she needed it nor did it reach
months later.  Prakash filed a case
in  a  district  level  Consumer
Disputes Redressal Commission in
New  Delhi.  All  the  steps  he
undertook  are  illustrated  here.
These  days  consumer  as  an
individual or as a group (called class
action  suit)  file  a  complaint  both
Physically  or  through  internet  and
conduct  the  case  through  video
conferencing.

The consumer movement in India
has led to the formation of various
organisations,  locally  known  as
consumer  forums  or  consumer
protection  councils.  They  guide
consumers on how to file cases in the
Consumer  Disputes  Redressal
Commissions. On many occasions,
they  also  represent  individual
consumers  in  these  commissions.
These voluntary organisations also
receive  financial  support  from  the
government for creating awareness
among people.

If  you  are  living  in  a  residential
colony,  you  might  have  noticed
boards  of  Residents’  Welfare
Associations. If there is any unfair
trade  practice  meted  out  to  their
members, they take up the case on
their behalf.

Under COPRA, a three-tier quasi-
judicial machinery at the district, state

and  national  levels  was  set  up  for
redressal of consumer disputes. The
district-level authority called District
Consumer  Disputes  Redressal
Commission  deals  with  the  cases
involving claims up to Rs 1 crore, the
state-level  Consumer  Disputes
Redressal Commissions called State
Commission between Rs 1 crore and
Rs  10  crore  and  the  national-level
commission — National Commission
— deals with cases involving claims
exceeding  Rs  10  crore.  If  a  case  is
dismissed
district-level
commission,  a  consumer  can  also
appeal  in  the  state  and  then  in
national-level commissions.

LET’S  WORK  THIS  OUT

Arrange the following in the correct order.

(a) Arita files a case in the District Consumer Disputes

Redressal  Commission.

(b) She engages a professional person.

(c) She realises that the dealer has given her defective

material.

(d) She  starts  attending  the  commission  proceedings.

(e) She goes and complains to the dealer and the Branch

office, to no effect.

(f) She is asked to produce the bill and warranty before

the  commission.

(g) She purchases a wall clock from a retail outlet.

(h) Within a few months, the dealer was ordered by the
commission to replace her old wall clock with a brand
new one at no extra cost.

CONSUMERS

while purchasing various goods and services, we will be

calls  for  acquiring  the  knowledge
and skill to become a well-informed
consumer.  How  do  we  become
conscious of our rights? Look at the
posters  on  the  right  and  in  the
previous page. What do you think?

The enactment of COPRA has led
to  the  setting  up  of  separate
Departments of Consumer Affairs in
central and state governments. The
posters that you have seen are one
example through which government
spread  information  about  legal
process  which  people  can  use.
You  might  also  be  seeing  such
advertisements on television channels.

While buying many commodities, on the
cover, you might have seen a logo with the
letters ISI, Agmark, Hallmark or +F. These
logos and certification help consumers get
assured of quality while purchasing the
goods and services. The organisations that
monitor and issue these certificates allow
producers to use their logos provided they
follow certain quality standards.

Though these organisations develop quality
standards for many products, it is not
compulsory for all the producers to follow
standards. However, for some products that
affect the health and safety of consumers or
of products of mass consumption like LPG
cylinders, food colours and additives,
cement, packaged drinking water, it is
mandatory on the part of the producers to
get certified by these organisations.

LET’S  WORK  THESE  OUT

1.

Look at the posters and cartoons in this chapter. Think of any particular commodity
and the aspects that need to be looked at as a consumer. Design a poster for this.

2. Find out the nearest Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission for your area.

3. What is the difference between consumer protection council and Consumer Disputes

Redressal  Commission?

4. The  Consumer  Protection  Act  1986  ensures  the  following  as  rights  which  every

consumer  in  India  should  possess

(i) Right  to  choice.

(iv) Right  to  representation.

(ii) Right to information.

(v) Right  to  safety.

(iii) Right  to  redressal.

(vi) Right  to  consumer  education.

Categorise  the  following  cases  under  different  heads  and  mark  against  each  in
brackets.

(a) Lata got an electric shock from a newly purchased iron. She complained to the

shopkeeper immediately. (      )

(b) John  is  dissatisfied  with  the  services  provided  by  MTNL/BSNL/TATA  INDICOM
for  the  past  few  months.  He  files  a  case  in  the  District  Level  Consumer
Commission.  (      )

(c) Your friend has been sold a medicine that has crossed the expiry date and you

are advising her to lodge a complaint (      ).

(d) Iqbal makes it a point to scan through all the particulars given on the pack of any

item that he buys. (      )

(e) You  are  not  satisfied  with  the  services  of  the  cable  operator  catering  to  your

locality but you are unable to switch over to anybody else.  (      )

(f) You  realise  that  you  have  received  a  defective  camera  from  a  dealer. You  are

complaining to the head office persistently (      ).

5.

If  the  standardisation  ensures  the  quality  of  a  commodity,  why  are  many  goods
available in the market without ISI or Agmark certification?

6.

Find out the details of who provides Hallmark and ISO certification.

TAKING  THE  CONSUMER  MOVEMENT  FORWARD

India  has  been  observing  24
December as the National Consumers’
Day. It was on this day that the Indian
Parliament  enacted  the  Consumer
Protection Act in 1986. India is one
of the countries that have exclusive
authority for consumer redressal.

The consumer movement in India
has made some progress in terms of
numbers  of  organised  groups  and

their activities. There are today more
than 2000 consumer groups in the
country of which only about 50-60
are well organised and recognised for
their work.

However, the consumer redressal
process  is  becoming  cumbersome,
expensive and time consuming. Many
a  time,  consumers  are  required  to
engage lawyers. These cases require

time  for  filing  and  attending  the
commission proceedings etc. In most
purchases cash memos are not issued
hence evidence is not easy to gather.
Moreover  most  purchases  in  the
market  are  small  retail  sales.  The
COPRA  was  amended  in  the  year
2019
further  strengthen
consumers in India. Buying through
internet is now included. If there is any
service deficiency or defective product,
service provider or manufacturer is
also held responsible and would be
penalized  or  even  imprisoned.
Settlement of disputes with the help
of a neutral intermediary outside the
Consumer  Disputes  Redressal
Commission, called mediator, is now

encouraged  at  all  the  three  tiers
Consumer Commissions. After more
than  30  years  of  the  enactment  of
COPRA, consumer awareness in India
is spreading but slowly. Besides this
the enforcement of laws that protect
the
workers,  especially
unorganised  sectors  is  weak.
Similarly, rules and regulations for
working  of  markets  are  often  not
followed.

Nevertheless,  there  is  scope  for
consumers to realise their role and
importance.  It  is  often  said  that
consumer movements can be effective
only  with  the  consumers’  active
involvement. It requires a voluntary
effort  and  struggle  involving  the
participation of one and all.

shop  where  it  was  purchased,  they  sent  an  engineer  to  set  it  right.  The  CTV
continues to give trouble and Mrs Krishna no longer gets any reply to the complaint
she made to the dealer / shop. She decides to write to the Consumer Commission
in  her  area.  Write  a  letter  on  her  behalf.  You  may  discuss  with  your  partner  /
group members before you write it.

3. Establish a consumer club in your school. Organise mock consumer awareness
workshops like monitoring bookshops, canteen, and shops in your school area.

Suggested Pedagogical Processes in an Inclusive Setup
The curriculum in a classroom is same for everyone. This means
all  students  can  actively  participate  in  the  classroom.  There
may be some students who have learning difficulties including
language,  visual-spatial  or  mixed  processing  problems.  They
may require additional teaching support and some adaptation
in the curriculum. By considering the specific requirements of
children with special needs, few pedagogical processes for the
teachers are suggested below:
y	Use detailed verbal descriptions of graphical representations
and pictures like maps. These can also be made tactile with
proper contrasts.

y	Use models and block paintings.
y	Use  examples  from  everyday  life  for  explaining  various

facts/concepts.

193

Learning Outcomes at the Secondary Stage

y	Use audio visual materials like films and videos to explain
abstract concepts; for example, discrimination, stereotyping,
etc.

y	Develop  embossed  timeline  for  memorising;  for  example,

different historical periods.

y	Organise  group  work  involving  debates,  quizzes,  map

reading activities, etc.

y	Organise  excursions,  trips  and  visits  to  historical  places

(educational tour).

y	Involve students in exploring the environment using other

senses like smell and touch.

y	Give a brief overview at the beginning of each lesson.
y	Provide  photocopies  of  the  relevant  key  information  from

the lesson.

y	Highlight or underline the key points and words.
y	 Use visual or graphic organisers like timelines (especially for
explaining chronology of events), flow charts, posters, etc.
y	 Organise  group  work  involving  activities  like  cut  and  paste,
and make use of pictorial displays, models, pictures, posters,
flash  cards  or  any  visual  items  to  illustrate  the  facts  and
concepts.

y	Plan occasions with real life experiences.
y	Use films or documentaries and videos.
y	Use  magazines,  scrapbooks  and  newspapers,  etc.,  to  help

learners understand the textual material.
y	Draw links with what has been taught earlier.
y	Make use of multisensory inputs.
y	All  examples  given  with  pictures  in  the  textbook  can  be

narrated (using flash cards, if required).

y	While  teaching  the  chapters,  use  graphic  organisers,
timelines and tables as this will make the task simpler.

y	Maps should be enlarged and colour coded.
y	The  text,  along  with  pictures,  can  be  enlarged,  made
into  picture  cards  and  presented  sequentially  as  a  story.
Sequencing makes it easier to connect information.

y	Asking relevant questions frequently to check how much the
learner has learnt as it helps in assimilating information.
y	Teach and evaluate in different ways, for example, through
dramatisation, field trips, real life examples, project work,
etc.

y	Highlight all the important phrases and information.
