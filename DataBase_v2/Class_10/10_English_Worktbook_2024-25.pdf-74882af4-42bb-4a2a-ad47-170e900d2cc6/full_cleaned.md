# Foreword

Teaching and learning of language in school education should be based on the insight that language learning is a natural process which should be enhanced in school for academic and overall achievement of the learners. It is extremely important that learner-centric methodologies of language learning should be promoted for eliciting critical responses, and developing sensitivity to social issues.

The focus of language learning is on developing skills of language and communicative competence. Language learning progresses naturally with exposure to and use of language in meaningful situations. In this context, importance has been attributed in the National Curriculum Framework-2005, to methods of teaching which are process based. These give opportunities to learners for engaging with texts through various activities and exercises and equip them for self-assessment.

In multilingual India, English has been one of the languages which is being learnt in schools. It is therefore recommended that English be learnt along with the language of the learners since it leads to transference of skills from the child’s own language to the second language (English).

We, at the NCERT, make an endeavour to provide engaging, relevant, and authentic resources. This supplements and complements language acquisition and provides opportunities for learners to associate experiences with everyday life.

The Council had developed two books, First Flight (textbook) and Footprint without Feet (Supplementary Reader) for Class X based on the National Curriculum Framework-2005. The workbook, Words and Expressions 2 is a sequential continuation of these. It has been developed taking into account the feedback on these books and needs of learners and teachers.

The workbook has also taken into account the skills that are critical for overall development of the learners, such as the skills of collaboration, creativity and imagination, critical thinking and problem solving, communication and compassion.

We hope this workbook will serve as an effective instrument for learners and teachers for adding quality to the teaching and learning processes. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources and materials. All the publications of the Council are regularly revised on the basis of the feedback from students, parents, teachers, and teacher educators.

# Rationalisation of Content in the Textbooks

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise.

# Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:

• Content based on genres of literature in the textbooks and supplementary readers at different stages of school education   
• Content that is meant for achieving Learning Outcomes for developing language proficiency and is accessible at different stages   
• For reducing the curriculum load and examination stress in view of the prevailing condition of the Pandemic   
• Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning   
• Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes given above.

# About the Workbook

Words and Expressions 2 is a sequence to the textbook in English for Class X, First Flight. Like Words and Expressions 1, it is a self-study material. It lays emphasis on providing a variety of rich and comprehensible inputs. This gives learners exposure to the target language and enables them to further their skills in the English language. The passages and activities given here create opportunities for them to handle the English language for performing important language functions and help them develop critical thinking on contemporary concerns. The book is expected to help learners to read for meaning in context and also serve as a base for communication in the English language.

There are 11 units in this workbook. The chapters of the textbook and the units are to be taught in a coordinated manner. The units correspond to each lesson in the textbook. There are various tasks in each unit. ‘Let’s begin’ is followed by Comprehension passages, Vocabulary tasks, Grammar exercises, Editing, Listening, Speaking, and Writing activities. All units end with Project work reiterating the learning through elaborate activities. The sections have followed an integrated approach and focus on a particular skill of the English language.

The introductory section, ‘Let’s begin’ asks questions making the students think and discuss on the chapter they have read. They are asked to collect information, read various written texts and e-texts, watch, and listen to online resources from Internet services like YouTube. They can also refer to the materials given in the QR code of the textbook along with the reading aloud of the texts and recitation of the poems. They are required to work in groups of two or four, note down points, develop speech, debate, etc., and then to speak before the whole class. This follows an integrated process of reading with comprehension, reflection, writing, and expressing thoughts.

The themes of the unseen comprehension passages, span across the literary, cultural, and sociological realms—which appeal to and inspire the adolescents—are chosen based on the corresponding chapters in the textbook. Reading Comprehension has prose passages as well as poems. The familiarity of the context has been taken care of while selecting the passages. An attempt has been made to expose the learners to a variety of texts, comprehend the meaning of words in context, understand the theme, and answer factual and thoughtprovoking questions. Learners are also given opportunities to interpret poems, be acquainted with beautiful expressions, phrases, and understand the expressions of the images. Some questions have been given to infer meaning and other to inspire learners to think critically and bring out their deeper understanding of the text. Multiple choice questions are also given in the book for students to assess themselves.

The workbook is a self-study material for the students. They are encouraged to work in pairs or groups so that they support each other and learn from each other. However, if required, teachers may guide. A variety of tasks, exercises, and ‘Look up and understand’ are placed strategically to build vocabulary in the given context. The learners are encouraged to use the dictionary as often as required. The intention is to help them learn new words and their usages in different contexts. Further, ‘Proofreading marks’ have been given for students to learn the basics of proofreading and editing.

The written and spoken compositions are preceded by discussions in peer groups. The themes of the composition include contemporary issues like gender, environment, diversity, human values, animal rights, adolescent issues which are relevant to the age group, and appropriate in the contemporary time. This is to enable the learners to see the world, develop necessary skills, and face the challenges of the present as well as future.

Enough opportunities are given to the students to develop listening comprehension and to use the English language in real-life situations. It is reiterated that basic language skills are developed simultaneously, not in isolation, but in an integrated manner. So integrated listening and speaking activities are given in the book. Grammar activities are presented in everyday contexts and are given with keeping usage in mind, not the formal explication of grammatical concepts.

The fine distinction of the workbook is that it is directly addressed to the students. The language used is simple, so that there is less dependence on the teachers. The activities are simple and stress free, enabling the learners to complete these confidently. Self-learning is encouraged. The pair or group work will give students an opportunity to look at the work of their peers and make each of them feel both responsible as well as independent. Every learner has a unique learning style. The group work may help them understand their challenges, evaluate themselves vis-a-vis their peers, and find the best way to overcome them.

The project activities given at the end of each unit are expected to be engaging, across the entire curriculum and interdisciplinary. These help generate interest to explore, analyse, think critically, reflect, and then present thoughts orally or in writing.

‘Fun facts’ are given in the margins throughout the workbook, with the hope that the learner would have a lasting impression of the correct usage of the English language. Teachers must remember that ‘Fun facts’ are for joyful learning and non-evaluative.

It is hoped that this book will help students use the English language effectively and meaningfully for the purpose of communication which will make them proficient and perceptive users of the English language. They will find this workbook enjoyable and rewarding as it is learner-centered and activity based. Comments and suggestions on any aspect of the workbook are welcome. This would enable us to improve the next edition.

beguiling cordiality hamper snipping wagered

There was a tailor who was known for beating others in the art of being light-fingered and thievery. A trader swore that even with a hundred attempts, the tailor would not be able to take a coil of thread from him without his knowledge.

The trader was told that many others, more intelligent than him, had been beaten by the tailor. They said he should not imagine himself so great, for his ego would only give him worse troubles in competition with the tailor. Still, the trader became more competitive and made a wager that the tailor would not be able to rob him of anything.

He wagered an Arab horse with those who taunted him. If the tailor failed to steal, then they would have to give him a horse instead. That night, the trader lay awake troubled by the situation and could not sleep a wink.

In the morning, he put a piece of satin cloth under his arm and went to the bazaar and entered the shop and saluted the cunning rogue warmly. The tailor sprang up from his seat and welcomed the trader, inquiring about his health with cordiality exceeding even that of the trader, planting in his heart great feelings of affection for him. When the trader heard these songs of sweetness from the tailor, he flung down the piece of silk saying, “Cut this into a coat for me and make it wide below my navel so as not to hamper my legs and tight about it to show off my figure.”

The tailor answered, “O! kindly man, I will do you a hundred services,” and accepted the order. He measured the satin and inspected the working surface and all the time chatted away to the trader in idle gossip, about other amirs and of bounties and gifts he had received from them, and about misers and their mean ways, and made the trader laugh with hysterics. During this beguiling talk, he was snipping away with his scissors rapidly, cutting as fast as his lips moved.

The trader was laughing, the tailor was cutting, the trader closed his eyes in joy, the tailor cut extra pieces, tucking them under his thighs, hidden away from all but God. From his delight at the tailor’s tales, the trader’s former boast went out of his mind. What satin? What boast? What wager? The trader was drunk on the jokes told by the tailor.

Then the tailor told such an incredible story that the trader fell over on his back with laughter. The tailor swiftly stitched a swatch of the satin to the hem of his underpants while the trader was paying no attention at all, greedily sucking with every guffaw at the jests the tailor told. The tailor continued to tell funnier and funnier tales and jokes until the trader was completely within his power.

With his eyes shut and his reason vanished, the bewildered and boastful trader was drunk with joy. And the tailor continued to cut, filching yet more of the beautiful cloth, with nothing to stop him now. And yet the trader begged for more.

You who becomes the slave of the jest, no story is more laughable than you yourself, think on this at the edge of your grave. How long will you listen to the lies of this world that leave your mind and spirit unhinged? The Universal Tailor will cut and stitch the hems of a hundred travellers, silly as children.

Eventually the tailor became bored with the whole story and told the trader that he better leave before another tale was told, “For if I tell another one, the coat will be too tight for you, and you will stop laughing and weep tears of blood.”

# Speaking

1. Lencho, the main character in the story, is a farmer. He supports his family through farming. The conflict in the story happens when a hailstorm strikes the field and destroys his farm. All the hard work, for nothing! The entire land is wrecked by catastrophe. There is no one who can help. Lencho’s complete faith in God is amazing during the calamity.

So, one type of conflict dominating in the story is man versus nature. Discuss with your partner the natural calamities that play havoc in the lives of people. Collect photographs and make a visual presentation to share in the class.

2. Try writing a small poem on the topic man versus nature. Read aloud the poem with the required stress and intonation. Given below is a poem written by Norman Littleford, which may help you think and compose.

# Man vs Nature

The heavens roared with thunder

as lightning filled the skies

was this God getting angry

or Nature’s big surprise.

Is Mother Nature telling us

the best way that she can

to stop the interference

and abuse she gets from man.

We marvel at her beauty

each time we look around

then dig up all her treasures

from their natural burial ground.

We forget that Nature gives us

all that keeps us living

we take it all and still want more

but never think of giving.

We build across the countryside

progressing every day

but Mother Nature can’t progress

for man is in the way.

Norman Littleford

# Project

1. You may have come across some people in your neighbourhood who might have inspired you with their actions. Talk to them about—

their childhood, their education, job, their likes and dislikes   
their contribution to the enrichment of their village or town, job, country, etc.   
their interesting features and characteristics

Request for their pictures. Based on the collected information, write their portraits and present it to the class. You may read on ‘How to do project work?’ given below.

# How to do project work in the English language classroom?

In addition to the textbook activities, project work could be used as an effective strategy to promote collaborative ways of language learning where we work together in groups to do an activity. We collect information, ideas; observe the language being used; use language in real life situations; exchange views and debate on ideas; write the ideas into a report; edit our writing and produce the report in a suitable form. This helps in constructing ideas and analysing critical judgments of the peers to arrive at a decision or conclusion.

It would be of much benefit to learners, if projects planned are of an interdisciplinary nature.

# Designing and managing projects

There are many ways students can be initiated to carry out projects.

Read books, newspapers, listen to the radio, watch TV, consult websites and encyclopedia, talk to people, observe events and proceedings, interview people, record audio/ video, collect pictures and illustrations, interpret them, and report.   
Write field notes to remember and organise the data collected.

Bring your own ideas to the class and have a class discussion.   
Use language meaningfully and precisely. If the meaning of learning is ‘meaning making’, the purpose is achieved fully while doing projects.   
Learners should do the projects in group independently. They should not ask their parents to do these or buy readymade products available in the market.   
They may seek information or some help from parents or elders.

# Planning, writing the draft and editing

Having collected the required data, information and ideas, plan and organise the data and interpret them to write the draft. It could be posters, a script of a play (enact and direct a play), songs, essays, etc. Editing is an important part of writing the report. Students should be made aware of process approach involved in writing a good piece of work. Then present it to the whole class or to the school during the assembly or on special occasions (in case of play, songs, etc.).

# Sardar Patel’s Call to Youth to build Character and be Disciplined

I must thank you for the affectionate and warm welcome which you have extended to me and for the love and regard which you

![](images/0256b735d583101b243cabc02a6be79bb869ba0bf9af7de1c538cc7e0fa011fb.jpg)

have shown me by conferring this honour to me. Gifts are of many kinds those achieved by one’s own endeavour are good and deserved, but no gift should be conferred on one whose worthiness has not been tested. By selecting me without assuring yourself of my fitness for the gift, you have laid me under a heavy debt and, by your injunctions that I should continue to prove worthy of it throughout my life, you have imposed on me a very difficult obligation. At present, I cannot say anything because I by your love and affection; and, therefore, with your and God’s grace, I pray that I may prove worthy of it. I fail, the blame for my failure will be shared by you

this occasion, I wish to place before you a few hts which occur to my mind as incidental to our won freedom. We have now won our freedom. But as I am doubtful, if I deserved the honour that have done me, you have also to think whether you done everything to deserve freedom that you have ined after such a bitter and sustained struggle.

here are people who think that having won freedom, e is nothing more to do about it. Freedom has come s through sacrifices. Those who made sacrifices d the fruit of their efforts and self-denials, but it is for who are now enjoying freedom to taste its fruit. After t World War, there is an all-round deterioration in standards. People have become self-centered. They gotten or ignored the wider interests of the country. ntial and noteworthy features of our struggle were: e, truth, and non-violence. The weapons of the

orld War were: violence, brute force, political and military moves, and counter moves. As a result of the churning of the ocean, the world has emitted poison. That poison is spreading all over and there is none to swallow it. The countries which

were free have managed to digest it somewhat, but we, who have just attained our freedom, it is hard to do the same. Therefore, those who think that having attained freedom they have attained everything have really attained nothing! The freedom that we have won is yet to be consolidated. The foundations of freedom have to be well and truly laid! This one-year old child has to be nursed and nourished, instructed and strengthened. It is for us to do it and we must do it.

In India today, there is no time for useless controversies and unnecessary debates and disputes. One can indulge in these pastimes when one has time and leisure. At present, we have to occupy ourselves with the all absorbing task of making the foundation of our freedom strong and unassailable. We have to reflect on our place in this broken and destructed world and what our duty and obligations are! If we fail to make the best use of our freedom to make it worthwhile and turn it to our advantage and advancements, future generations will heap curses on us. They will say that a spiritualist, a great soul gave us this precious boon, but we did not know how to retain it and lost it.

I should like to urge upon those who train citizens of tomorrow and to those citizens of tomorrow that we have yet to stand on our feet. We must concentrate on one thing alone, viz., how to make our country strong and united. We can make it strong when hearts are pure and when we fully appreciate our duty. Now that foreign rulers have gone, are we in a position to sustain the whole burden that has devolved on us? When we took over from them, the administrative fabric was in tatters. We have to mend and place it. This, in itself, is a heavy responsibility. It is for our universities to train young men to shoulder these responsibilities.

The great university of life is full of experiences, but to make full use of those experiences, all of us students, teachers and professors—have to be cautious and on guard.

The most essential requisite is character. If your character is lacking and you leave the precincts of the alma mater without your character fully developed, you will be wasting an opportunity of a lifetime.

You have to realise that India has to attain its rightful place in the comity of nations. The leadership of Asia would be hers if she conducts herself well and if her citizens make their fitting contribution to nation’s resurgence. Whatever trials and troubles we might have passed through, there is no denying the fact that we have a precious inheritance and the teachings we have received from the departed leaders are great assets for us.

India abounds in the resources of nature and manpower. They are awaiting full use. That task must devolve on young men and women. We ourselves were trained in the school of experience. We fought for freedom and we have attained that prize for you. It is now up to you to prove yourself worthy of the same. This you can do only if you work with single-minded devotion to the cause of the country. It is only then that you can deserve this freedom and be proud of it.

# Look Up and Understand

comity of nations communalism inheritance resurgence

The real danger of India lies in our disunity. That poison of communalism was spread in the past. You should draw a curtain over it. Only then could we equip ourselves for the freedom that has come to us. There are still people in the country whose loyalty to India has not settled down. They should and will leave India.

This is the occasion for mutual help and mutual cooperation. We must know what our duty is as true citizens. Your teacher has to impart that duty. Unless we learn to shoulder our responsibility in the true spirit of discipline and citizenship we cannot go ahead. We must strengthen our shoulders and our legs so that we can stand erect and bear the burden that has devolved on us. Then alone would we secure the real objective of freedom.

# Reading Compr ehension

# Text I

Let’s now read the story of a bus conductor and his passengers with a dog. The story is written by A.G Gardiner.

# All about a Dog

It was a bitterly cold night, and even at the far end of the bus the east wind that raved along the street cut like a knife. The bus stopped and two women and a man got in together and filled the vacant places. The young woman was dressed in sealskin, and carried one of those little Pekinese dogs that women in sealskin like to carry in their laps. The conductor came in and took the fares. Then his eyes rested with old malice on the beady eyed toy dog. I saw trouble brewing. This was the opportunity for which he had been waiting and he intended to make the most of it. I had marked him as the type of what Mr. Wells has called the Resentful Employee, the man with a great vague grievance against everything and a particular grievance against passengers who came and sat in his seat while he shivered at the door.

“You must take that dog out,” he said with sour venom.

“I shall certainly do nothing of the kind. You can take my name and address,” said the woman, who had evidently expected the challenge and knew the reply.

“You must take the dog out— that’s my orders.”

“I won’t go on the top in such weather. It would kill me,” said the woman.

“Certainly not,” said her lady companion, “You’ve got a cough as it is.”

“It’s nonsense,” said her male companion.

# Look Up and Understand

bitterly embittered evidently malice

Look Up and Understand avalanche imperiously imperturbably indignant quarterdeck

The conductor pulled the bell and the bus stopped. “This bus doesn’t go until that dog is brought out.” And he stepped on to the pavement and waited. It was his moment of triumph. He had the law on his side and the whole bus full of angry people under the harrow. His embittered soul was having a real holiday.

The storm inside rose high “Shameful!” “He’s no better than a German.” “Why isn’t he in the army?” “Call the police. Let’s all report him.” “Let’s make him give us our fares back.” Everybody was on the side of the lady and the dog.

That little animal sat blinking at the dim lights in happy unconsciousness of the rumpus of which he was the cause. The conductor came to the door, “What’s your number?” said one, taking out a pocket-book with a gesture of terrible things. “There’s my number,” said the conductor imperturbably. “Give us our fares back.” “You can’t leave us here all night.” “No fares back,” said the conductor.

Two or three passengers got out and disappeared into the night. The conductor took another turn on the pavement, then went and had a talk with the driver. Another bus, the last on the road, sailed by indifferent to the shouts of the passengers to stop, “They stick by each other the villains,” was the comment.

Someone pulled the bell violently. That brought the driver round to the door, “Who’s conductor of this bus?” he said and paused for reply. “None coming,” he returned to his seat, and resumed beating his arms across his chest. There was no hope in that quarter. A policeman strolled up and looked in at the door. An avalanche of indignant protests and appeals burst on him. “Well, he’s got his rules, you know,” he said. “Give your name and address.” “That’s what he’s been offered, and he won’t take it.” “Oh,” said the policeman, and he went away and took his stand a few yards down the street, where he was joined by two more constables.

And still the little dog blinked at the lights, and the conductor walked to and fro on the pavement, like a captain on the quarterdeck in the hour of victory. A young woman, whose voice had risen high above the gale inside, descended on him with an air of threatening and slaughter. He was immovable as cold as the night, and as hard as the pavement. She passed on in a fury of impotence to the three policemen, who stood like a group of statuary on the street watching the drama. Then she came back,

imperiously beckoned to her ‘young man’ who had sat a silent witness of her rage, and vanished. Others followed. The bus was emptying. Even the dashing young fellow who had demanded the number and who had declared he would see this thing through if he sat there all night, had taken an opportunity to slip away.

Meanwhile the Pekinese party was passing through every stage as of resistance to abject surrender. “I’ll go on the top.” said the sealskin lady at last. “You mustn’t.” “I will.” “You’ll have pneumonia.”

“Let me take it.” (This from the man) “Certainly not.” She would die with her dog. When she had disappeared up the stairs, the conductor came back, pulled the bell, and the bus went on. He stood sourly triumphant while his conduct was savagely discussed in his face by the remnant of the party.

Then the engine struck work, and the conductor went to help the driver. It was a long job and presently the lady with the dog stole down the stairs and re-entered the bus. When the engine was put right, the conductor came back and pulled the bell. Then his eyes fell on the dog, and his hand went to the bell-rope again. The driver looked around, the conductor pointed to the dog, the bus stopped, and the struggle recommenced with all the original features — the conductor walking the pavement, the driver smacking his arms on the box, the little dog blinking at the lights, the sealskin lady declaring that she would not go on the top and finally going.

“I’ve got my rules,” said the conductor to me when I was the last passenger left behind. He had won his victory, but felt that he would like to justify himself to somebody. “Rules,” I said,“ are necessary things, but there are rules and rules. Some are hard and fast rules, like the rules of the road, which cannot be broken without danger to life and limb. But some are only rules for guidance, which you can apply or wink at, as common sense dictates, like that rule about the dogs. They are not a whip, put in your hand to scourge your passengers with, but an authority for an emergency. They are meant to be observed in the spirit, not in the letter, for the comfort and not the discomfort of the passengers. You have kept the rule and broken its spirit. You may mix your rules with a little goodwill and good temper.” He took it very well and when I got off the bus he said “Good night” quite amiably.

Now, complete the box narrating the story in the correct sequence.

# Grammar

# A.	 Phrasal verbs

The sentence below is taken from the text you have read. The phrase in italic is a phrasal verb. A phrasal verb is a combination of words (a verb $^ +$ a preposition, for example check in or a verb $^ +$ an adverb, for example break down). When they are used together, they usually take on a different meaning to that of the original verb.

…Walk away from the old Dakota.

walk away is a phrasal verb which means to move away from.

Find out the meaning of the following phrasal verbs and use them appropriately in sentences.

(a) walk in   
(b) walk out   
(c)	 take away   
(d)	 take up   
(e)	 take in   
(f)	 take out   
(g)	 give away   
(h)	 give in   
(i)	 give up   
(j)	 put in

(k)	 put away   
(l)	 put out

# B. The Passive

Compare the two sentences given below:

Ramesh painted the walls.

The walls were painted by Ramesh.

The first sentence is in active form and the second sentence is in passive form. When the person doing the action (Ramesh) is the subject, we use the verb in the active voice. When the subject is what the action is directed at (the walls), we use the verb in the passive voice. In the first sentence, we talked about Ramesh but in the second sentence we talked about what happened to the walls.

In the passive sentence we use by+agent to add important information, that is by Ramesh. We can leave out by+agent if it does not provide any specific information.

Example:

All the students were given sweets yesterday.

My room is cleaned everyday in the morning.

A large number of films on wildlife conservation have been made. Use the words given below and frame sentences using the passive forms of the verbs.

Examples:

•	 Rice/cultivate/Gangetic valley and coastal region. (Simple Present) Rice is cultivated in Gangetic valley and coastal region.   
•	 The documents/sign/principal. (Present Perfect) The documents have been signed by the principal.   
(a)	 Taj Mahal/build/Shah Jahan. (Simple Past)   
(b)	 Malaria virus/transmit/female Anopheles mosquito. (Simple Present)   
(c)	 The case/solve/police and two persons arrest. (Present Perfect)

# Comma

Comma can be used to set off a dependent clause at the beginning of a sentence.

After working for an hour, he decided to rest for a while.

(d)	 Many houses/and lives/destroy/the volcanic eruption in Mt. Etna. (Simple Past)   
(e)	 The ultraviolet rays/prevent/the ozone layer/entering the earth’s surface. (Simple Present)   
(f)	 The field/convert/playground. (Present Perfect)

# C.	 Unscramble the following sentences to make meaningful ones:

(a)	 records/flying/many/who/American aviator/was an/ Amelia Earhart/set   
(b)	 the first/across/woman/solo/to fly/the Atlantic Ocean/ she/became   
(c)	 a flight/July 1937/the globe/Earhart/disappeared/ to circumnavigate/somewhere/over the/Pacific/in/ during   
(d)	 was never/found/and/she was/officially declared/ plane wreckage/lost/at sea/her

The World Wars fought in the past stand testimony to the fact that fighting wars brings severe human suffering. The sufferers, including women and children are left behind with trauma and indelible impressions on their minds. You have read in the Class X English textbook the account of one such war in the diary of Anne Frank who captured the miseries of war in her diary. Discuss how you may relate to Anne Frank’s feelings of alienation and isolation.

# Text I

The following excerpt is from the diary of Lena Mukhina, a teenage girl who had undergone the atrocities of Germans when they fortified the city of Leningrad. The siege of Leningrad is an important landmark in the history of Russia. The siege of Leningrad lasted from September 1941 to 1944. The city was cut off from the rest of Russia. The Germans continuously bombarded the city which resulted in death, destruction, and starvation of the people. However, the resolute Russians were warned in the beginning that the enemy was at the gate and it was a question of life and death. They fought bravely and failed the Germans in their evil designs.

Read the excerpt and answer the questions that follow.

# Foreword from The Diary of Lena Mukhina

No one could possibly have known that the city would remain in the grip of siege for 872 days and nights. But Leningrad’s citizens had begun to feel the breath of war as early as September. Daily

nd artillery bombardment of residential rhoods drove the city’s inhabitants into elters, several times a day, and for hours at People’s initial curiosity in the aftermath first bomb attacks soon gave way to fear then, in conditions of appalling hunger d cold, to apathy. Leningraders welcomed nclement weather for the reduced visibility it brought. They came to dread sunny days and moonlit nights, when the Germans would be sure to bomb their city. Cloud cover, however, offered no protection from artillery fire: in just over six months from the start of the siege there were only thirty-two days when shells did not explode on the city’s streets.

Hunger soon set in. Between September

and November 1941 the bread rations that had been announced in July were reduced five times, reaching their lowest point on 20 November—125 ‘blockade grams’ for children, dependents and white-collar workers and $2 5 0 \mathrm { g }$ for manual workers, technicians and engineers. Rations of meat, butter, sugar and other food items were severely reduced. The summer months and the beginning of autumn, when it was still possible to buy food without ration cards in ordinary shops and canteens were no more than a distant memory.

# Q.1. Infer the meanings of the following expressions. The first has been done for you as an example.

(a) to feel the breath of war: there were indications that war was going to start soon   
(b) appalling hunger and cold:   
(c) start of the siege:   
(d) blockade grams:

Q.2. List the words from the passage which are related to the war, for example ‘bombardment’.

# Q.3. Answer the following questions:

(a) Who were the captives as stated in the above passage?   
(b) Why did the people under siege welcome the bad weather conditions?   
(c) What were the fears in the mind of the people?   
(d) Have the people lost hope or reconciled to the existing situation?

# Q.4. Tick the correct answer

‘…when it was still possible to buy food without ration cards in ordinary shops and canteens were no more than a distant memory.’ It means:

(a) There was hope of getting ration soon.   
(b) Citizens under siege had to show their ration cards for buying food.   
(c) There were shops and canteen for buying food for the people under siege.   
(d) The possibility of buying the food without a ration card as in the past, was no more than a memory now.

# Text II

There are many ways of recording the events, news, and personal experiences. Diary writing, logbook, daybook, journal, etc. are a few to name. The journal writing is about writing the everyday record of an event or writing about an event, activity or experience, etc.

The following is an excerpt from the beginning of A Journal of the Plague Year by Daniel Defoe.

# A Journal of the Plague Year

It was about the beginning of September, 1664, that I, among the rest of my neighbours, heard in ordinary discourse that the plague was returned again in Holland; for it had been very violent there, and particularly at Amsterdam and Rotterdam, in the year 1663, whither, they say, it was brought, some said from Italy, others from the Levant, among some goods which were brought home by their Turkey fleet; others said it was brought from Candia; others from Cyprus. It mattered not from whence it came; but all agreed it was come into Holland again.

We had no such thing as printed newspapers in those days to spread rumours and reports of things, and to improve them by the invention of men, as I have lived to see practiced since. But such things as these were gathered from the letters of merchants and others who corresponded abroad, and from them were handed about by word of mouth only; so that things did not spread instantly over the whole nation, as they do now.

But it seems that the Government had a true account of it, and several councils were held about ways to prevent its coming over; but all was kept very private. Hence, it was that this rumour died off again, and people began to forget it as a thing we were very little concerned in, and that we hoped was not true; till the latter end of November or the beginning of December 1664 when two men, said to be Frenchmen, died of the plague in Long Acre, or rather at the upper end of Drury Lane. The family they were in endeavoured to conceal it as much as possible, but as it had gotten some vent in the discourse of the neighbourhood, the Secretaries of State got knowledge of it; and concerning themselves to inquire about it, in order to be certain of the truth, two physicians and a surgeon were ordered to go to the house

and make inspection. This they did; and finding evident tokens of the sickness upon both the bodies that were dead, they gave their opinions publicly that they died of the plague. Whereupon, it was given in to the parish clerk, and he also returned them to the Hall; and it was printed in the weekly bill of mortality in the usual manner, thus — Plague 2. Parishes infected 1.

Q.1. The above passage is written in the English that was prevalent in the eighteenth century. Find some words and phrases from the text which seem different as compared to the English language usage at present. List them and find an appropriate substitute for each. Look at the example given below:

Lena Mukhina’s Diary 22 May 1941–25 May 1942

‘Remember My Sad Story: Lena Mukhina’s Siege Diary’

Consider any day on which you do not discover anything new or learn anything useful a lost day!

Anyone can become strong, smart and steadfast. There is only one essential requirement–will power!

Will power can conquer anything.

A strong-willed person is persistent and determined.

People are not born brave, strong and smart.

These qualities must be acquired through perseverance and with determination, like the ability to read and write.

One of the three islands in the Juan Fernandez archipelago, 700 km off the Pacific coast of Chile was discovered in the 16th century. Alexander Selkirk, the Scottish sailor was marooned there for four years and four months. He related his experience to Daniel Defoe, who wrote his famous adventure book Robinson Crusoe based on the sailor’s experience, since then the island is known as Robinson Crusoe.

There is a seemingly unbelievable true story of the orphaned bear cub, which was found by Polish troops during World War II who travelled with them through Iraq, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Italy and Scotland. During the war, Wojciech Narebski and his fellow Polish servicemen had to lift crates of heavy metal artillery. Fortunately for them, one of the soldiers had superhuman strength: Corporal Wojtek, a Syrian brown bear. When the bear saw that soldiers were struggling, he’d want to help... he’d come over, grab a crate and carry it to the truck. This can be heavy work, even for a bear. When Wojtek (bear) got tired, he would simply stack one crate on top of the other which also helped the soldiers because they didn’t have to lift the crate off the ground. Of course, Corporal Wojtek (bear) got a reward of honey and marmalade. That was his favourite!

The following is an excerpt about the Parsi community in India and their food.

Read the passage and answer the questions.

“Aavoji, aavo, aavo! Welcome to Delhi! Let me show you my beautiful city.” The booming voice of Nowrosji Kapadia could be heard across the length and breadth of the platform. It was Nowrosji’s favourite pastime: a walk to the Old Delhi railway station to greet the Frontier Mail as it chugged into Delhi from Mumbai to Peshawar. With this refrain, an eager Nowrosji would cajole Parsi visitors off the train and take them home for a meal and often persuade some to stay overnight or for a few days. He

cajole dainty extensive overruled vouch

would use this opportunity to tell them about the advantages of shifting to Delhi. Though his wife Jer Bai would occasionally object to unknown visitors, she was always overruled. This was the beginning of the community of Parsis in Delhi....

...Writing about Parsis in the Delhi of old is not easy. There are memories of my grandparents and parents—a collective memory of generations past and people long gone, yet here in spirit.... During festive gatherings, the women went to town with the food; outside catering was unheard of. The poorer members of the community never knew who had paid for what. This tradition continued in the northern cities of Lucknow, Kanpur, and Allahabad well into the ‘70s. Sadly, that kind of life has almost gone forever.

Food preparations began two days in advance. Dar ni pori (rich pastry stuffed with sweetened lentils) and malido (halwa) were carried in big vatus (pots) and served with puris. Anyone who has made malido can vouch for the fact that you need strong biceps; it is an exhausting exercise. The first time I made it under my grandmother’s supervision was also the last. I could hardly move my arms for the next two days! Since then, I gained a healthy respect for my dainty grandmother.

The menu was extensive. Breakfast would start with either sev—brown vermicelli cooked in milk and served with fresh cream—or ravo, semolina pudding, Mithu dahi or sweetened curd made with full cream milk was an absolute must. This was followed by bafellaeeda, hard-boiled eggs, and kheemo kaleji, mutton mince with liver. For lunch, there was almost always smori dal chawal and macchi no patio—white boiled rice with yellow dal offset by a tart and tangy fish curry.

Teatime was special at our home. My grandmother made it a point to dress for tea; I was made to do the same. Once we were ready, out came the treats: Parsi biscuits—batasa, nankhatai and flaky khari; patrel, rolled, steamed arbi leaves stuffed with besan masala; kumas, rich Parsi cake; and my favourite, bhakra, sweet deep fried doughnuts. That tradition has stayed with me. I certainly don’t dress up, but I still need a snack with at least three cups of tea!...

You have read about Coorg, its rainforests, and coffee and tea from Assam in ‘Glimpses of India’ (First Flight, Class X textbook, NCERT). The following extract is about the cultivation of coffee in Araku valley in Andhra Pradesh. The story of Araku Valley traverses an unusual trajectory through Adivasi empowerment, hot-air balloons and some of the best coffee in the world.

Read the passage given below and answer the questions.

Located at about $1 { , } 2 0 0 \mathrm { m }$ above sea level, the valley, tucked away in the north-eastern corner of Andhra Pradesh, shares a border with Odisha. For guests and participants at the Araku Balloon Festival (ABF), held between 18-20 January every year, this is sightseeing like nothing else.

The drive to far-flung coffee estates takes us through the five northern mandals of Anantha giri, Dumbriguda, Hukumpeta, Munchingi Puttu and Araku valley. The name Araku for the coffee was chosen simply because it sounded poetic. The view from the ground level is as impressive as the one from above — the landscape changes from densely forested hills to sweeping valleys and terrace farms surrounding occasional village clusters. The journey of Araku Coffee from a livelihood initiative by the Naandi Foundation to a globally appreciated product has been in the making for over a decade. It is also intrinsically tied to the history of how coffee arrived in this valley. It was a British civil servant, N.S. Brodie, who introduced coffee to these hill tracts in 1898.

bio-dynamic entrepreneurs intrinsically mandals terroirs (ter’wa:) trajectory traverses tucked

# Look Up and Understand

Today, Araku coffee is a brand that works with 517 villages and 10,986 farmers, all of whom are estate owners and entrepreneurs with a stake in the business. The reason the coffee is of such high quality is that it follows the best practices of bio-dynamic farming by creating an interconnected and symbiotic ecosystem. The soil is enriched through composting and a variety of shade trees are planted, including cash-yielding fruit trees like mango and jackfruit. Terroirs are assessed and careful standard operating procedures are put in place from “sapling to savouring”, which ensures healthier plants and sweeter cherries and eventually a far superior coffee aroma and flavour.

# The Valley of Flowers

The journey to the Valley of Flowers begins about 16 km away from Joshimath, at Govindghat (1,770 m) on the Rishikesh-Badrinath heightway. The Valley of Flowers is covered with a rich varity of magnifiscent plants.

Over the past few years, thousand of visitors have ‘discovered’ this idyll amidst the mountain. However, they live like marks only by way of empty cans, waste-paper and cigarete butts. Trakking in the area has resulted in the trampling of these delikate plants by humans and ponies. As a result, the government of India was compeled to ban all mountainering, trekking, expeditions and livestock grasing in the area, with effect from February 20, 1983. This is to privent further damage to one of our nation’s unique repositories of natural beauty.

# Listening

Ask your classmate or teacher to read aloud the following passage from the text ‘Glimpses of India’ (First Flight, Class X textbook). Listen carefully, and note down the keywords, main ideas and interesting expressions in your notebook while listening.

During our childhood in Goa, the baker used to be our friend, companion and guide. He used to come at least twice a day. Once, when he set out in the morning on his selling round, and then again, when he returned after emptying his huge basket. The jingling thud of his bamboo woke us up from sleep and we ran to meet and greet him. Why was it so? Was it for the love of the loaf? Not at all. The loaves were bought by some Paskine or Bastine, the maid-servant of the house! What we longed for were those bread-bangles which we chose carefully. Sometimes it was sweet bread of a special kind.

The baker made his musical entry on the scene with the ‘jhang, jhang—sound of his specially made bamboo staff. One hand supported the basket on his head and the other banged the bamboo on the ground. He would greet the lady of the house with a “Good morning” and then place his basket on the vertical bamboo. We kids would be pushed aside with a mild rebuke and the loaves would be delivered to the servant. But we would not give up. We would climb a bench or the parapet and peep into the basket, somehow. I can still recall the typical fragrance of those loaves; loaves for the elders and the bangles for the children. Then we did not even care to brush our teeth or wash our mouths properly. And why should we? Who would take the trouble of plucking the mango leaf for the toothbrush? And why was it necessary at all? The tiger never brushed his teeth. Hot tea could wash and clean up everything so nicely, after all!

Now summarise the paragraph using your notes.

In Kashmir, the Kandur shop isn’t just a place where one goes to buy the morning and evening breads, it is a social hub. It is a place where you get to hear and participate in discussions that range from gossip to political discourses. The Kandur shop or Kandur waan as it is called in Kashmiri has variety of breads for different occasions that are baked in the Kandur’s oven.

# Read about some of the Kashmiri breads:

Tsot-Girda : is a medium sized round everyday bread that is a must on every breakfast table in Kashmir.

Lavasa : is a puffy level bread made from maida.

Tsochwor or Tilvor : is a bagel shaped, slightly hard bread with a sprinkling of sesame seeds on top. The baker prepares ‘tsochwor’ at noon time to be enjoyed with the afternoon tea.

Kulcha : These are crispy palm-sized breads sprinkled with poppy seeds. These are—mith (sweet) and namkeen (savoury). The bread is taken with some traditional Dodh Kehva (milk Kehva).

Sheermal : is another type of bread from Kashmir. It is mildly sweet.

Roath : The sweet bread with a cake like texture is baked in traditional tandoor and is topped with

dry fruits. However, this one bread is made for grand occasions like weddings, child birth or engagements and served with Kehva.

The following is a story of a baby Civet cat that fell from a tree and was raised by humans. It is a true story from Assam written by Rommel Shunmugam who is a conservation photographer. Through his photo stories, he seeks to inculcate in children a love for nature and wildlife.

Civet cats are found in most parts of India. They are also called toddy cats. They live on palm trees and love to drink the sweet sap, which is collected by toddy tappers to make wine! Dharini and his family rescues and rehabilitates wild animals. These are mostly babies or animals that cannot look after themselves.

# Baby Bhakat

Hi! My name is Bhakat. I am a baby Civet cat. I am three month old. Shhh! I am taking a nap with my brothers. Yes, I live in a family of humans. They treat me like their own Baby!

My home is a little thatched hut by a river in a small village in Assam. The hut has an earthen floor and mud-splattered walls. Its doors are always open. I come and go as I please! Mama takes care of all three of us! Her name is Anjali. She cooks, cleans and plays with me. I secretly think she loves me the most. She lets me be real naughty!

Mama is about to make brunch! She is making roti and vegetables. I don’t like vegetables, but I like fruits. I love meat. I am omnivorous. Mama always feeds me before anyone else! I love things dipped in milk. They are yummy!

The man of the house is Dharini. If not for him, I would not be alive today! My civet mother built a nest for me in a very tall coconut tree. One night I slipped and fell to the ground! When villagers

found me they took me to Dharini. Dharini loves

animals. I began to live in his home. I was very small. I could not walk. I ate and slept a lot!

Do you know why my eyes are so large? That’s because I am a nocturnal animal. I sleep in the day and am active in the night. My large eyes help me see better in the dark! I also have a very long tail! It helps me balance on tree-tops and branches. I mostly live on trees, though I do come down to the ground. Animals like me are called arboreal!

Inside Dharini’s house, I always snooze in the rafters. I like being high up; it reminds me of trees! One day I woke up to find a strange sight, Dharini’s house was filling with water! In the night, the river behind the house started overflowing its banks! Inside everything was helter-skelter. Things were piled on top of one another! The monsoon had arrived!

Dharini and Anjali carried us babies outside the house! There was water everywhere and it was very muddy! But the sun was out and it was not raining! I stayed high on the fence and made sure even my long tail did not get wet! Dharini went to pick snails.

Snails had climbed branches and walls to escape drowning in the flood! Every gardener knows that snails eat plants. By eating snails, I ensure that they do not overrun your garden. I maintain the balance of life in nature!

When it floods, you find fish everywhere! Dharini cast his net in the garden and began catching fishes. They are kept in a pan of water to keep them alive and fresh to eat!

Montu, my brother, tried to be naughty! He caught me and threatened to dip me in water! He got a scolding from Dharini. I hate to be in water! Back inside the house, it is time for me to play with Mama! I shall rest awhile and then be up again at night. Mama always leaves a midnight snack by the lantern!

It’s not easy having Elephants in your backyard.

Around the world, as communities expand, and natural wild places are reduced, people and wildlife are increasingly coming into conflict over living space and food.

It might be baboons in Namibia attacking young goats or elephants in Nepal eating crops or European bears and wolves killing livestock. The problem is universal, affects rich and poor, and is bad news for all concerned.

The impacts are often huge. People lose their crops and livestock (and therefore a source of income and food security), property, and sometimes their lives—even a severe injury caused by wildlife can result in a loss of livelihood. The animals, some of which are already threatened or even endangered, are sometimes killed in retaliation or to prevent future conflicts.

Human-wildlife conflict is happening more and more, affecting a lot of different species. The effects of climate change will probably make the problem worse.

coexistence conflict endangered livestock retaliation

# How we are tackling human-wildlife conflict

The solutions are often specific to the wildlife or area concerned, and are often creative and simple—for instance planting a barrier of crops that repel the animals (elephants and some other wildlife don’t like chilli, for example).

An important aspect of the work is that it benefits both the animals and local people and actively involves the communities concerned (in the case of chilli, it can be sold to increase income). It’s about finding solutions that lead to mutually beneficial coexistence.

The work has also often led to people being more enthusiastic and supportive of conservation, and has demonstrated that people can live alongside wildlife while developing sustainable livelihoods.

# Text II

Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow.

# Animal rights

People who support animal rights recognise that all animals have an inherent worth, a value completely separate from their usefulness to humans. Every being with a will to live has the right to live free from exploitation and suffering.

All animals have the ability to suffer in the same way and to the same degree that humans do. They feel pain, pleasure, fear, frustration, loneliness, and familial love. Whenever we consider doing something that would interfere with their needs, we are morally obligated to take them into account.

People often ask if animal rights mean that animals should have the right to vote or drive a car. Of course, that would be silly because those aren’t rights that would benefit animals. But animals have the right not to suffer at the hands of humans and to live their lives free from suffering and exploitation because they have an interest in doing so. That is the difference between equal consideration and equal treatment.

Almost everyone cares about animals in some context, whether it’s a beloved family companion, an irresistibly cute kitten or a majestic wild animal seen in a documentary. After all, we each have some built-in capacity for empathy and compassion, as can

# Look Up and Understand

arbitrary compassion documentary empathy

be seen from the lengths that children often go to in order to help animals.

Logically and morally, there is no reason to differentiate in the way we treat the animals we share our homes with and those who are farmed for food. They are all individuals, with the same capacity to feel pain and fear. Animal rights help us to look past the arbitrary distinctions between different species, to rediscover our innate compassion, and to respect all animals equally.

Anyone who cares about animals can start putting these principles into practice every single day with the food they eat, the clothes they wear, and the products they buy. These choices are a form of non-violent protest that makes a real difference both by reducing the profits of corporations that harm or kill animals and by creating a growing market for cruelty-free food, fashion, services, and entertainment.

# Listening

1 . Following is a story of Gangaram, a 130 years old crocodile, who died in a Chhattisgarh village. Listen to the story carefully and answer the questions that follow. You can listen to the recorded story or ask your teacher, sibling or friend to read the story aloud.

The incident took place in Bawamohatra, a village in Bemetra district of Chhattisgarh. The residents of Bawamohatra gathered near the community pond and started weeping after they saw that the crocodile had died. The villagers were emotionally attached to the reptile and were heartbroken after his death. About 500 people of the small village attended the last rites of their beloved crocodile, Gangaram. The over three-metre long crocodile was buried in Chhattisgarh’s Bawamohatra village after his last rites were performed by the villagers. A forest department official estimated that the crocodile was 130 years old. The crocodile was carried to its funeral on a tractor decorated with flowers and garlands. The villagers say Gangaram was friendly. Even the kids of

the village could swim around him. He had never harmed or attacked anyone. He was not a crocodile but a friend and a divine creature for them, who was worshipped in this village. Some say that he would even eat rice and dal which was served by the villagers and kids. He was very understanding and if he saw anyone swimming near him, he used to go to the other side of the pond. Villagers used to identify themselves with the crocodile as people used to call this village—Magarmachha vala gaaon, the Crocodile’s village. In fact, the villagers now wish to build a statue of Gangaram near the pond to remember their friend, who got the village a new name. It may be weird, but it could be an example of how humans and animals can coexist without harming each other.

1. Why did the residents gather near the village pond?   
2. Why were the villagers crying?   
3. Who was Gangaram?   
4. How big was he?

In my opinion, there are very few ways to enjoy and appreciate the beauty of Uttarakhand and cycling is the most thrilling of them all. Sunlight filtering through the trees and a cool breeze gently caressing your faces as you ride, coupled with breathtaking views of sal forests spread like a green cover on the mountains and surrounding valleys, the experience of pedalling across the state is truly inexplicable. Of the many trails we navigated, there is one that occupies a special place in our hearts. It began from Ghanta Ghar, a popular tourist attraction in Dehradun, it took us through

some of the most picturesque locations of the state such as Kimadi, Hathi Paon, Mussoorie and Chaar Dukaan, right up to George Everest point. This $1 0 0 \mathrm { k m }$ ride (approximately) is also one of the few routes in Uttarakhand that encapsulates all the element that one expects while cycling here—steep slopes, sharp curves, endless hills, lush forests, and off-road experiences.

# Going Down Hill on a Bicycle, A Boy’s Song

With lifted feet, hands still,

I am poised, and down the hill

Dart, with heedful mind;

The air goes by in a wind.

Swifter and yet more swift,

Till the heart with a mighty lift

Makes the lungs laugh, the throat cry:—

“O bird, see; see, bird, I fly.

“Is this, is this your joy?

O bird, then I, though a boy,

For a golden moment share

Your feathery life in air!”

Say, heart, is there aught like this

In a world that is full of bliss?

‘Tis more than skating, bound

Steel-shod to the level ground.

Speed slackens now, I float

Awhile in my airy boat;

Till, when the wheels scarce crawl,

My feet to the treadles fall.

Alas, that the longest hill

Must end in a vale; but still,

Who climbs with toil, wheresoe’er,

Shall find wings waiting there.

1. Following is a passage on Mizoram and its people. When one visits this place, one is enchanted by its natural beauty and the vibrant culture of the state. Listen to the passage carefully and answer the questions that follow. You can listen to the recorded story or ask your teacher, sibling or friend to read the story aloud.

# Mizoram

Once a tourist remarked, “I visited the Eastern States this time—where the people talk in songs and they always dance.”

The eastern region of India is no doubt charmingly novel in many of its features. Mizoram, literally the land of Mizos is an expanse of blue-green hills. Mizoram is broken up lenghwise into five major mountain ranges gradually descending from the south to the north. The hills are rugged and their heights uneven. The name of the state Mizoram is made of two words. ‘Mi’ means human beings, ‘Zo’ means a hill. So, a ‘Mizo’ is a human dweller of a hill; Mizoram means the land of the hilldwellers. Aizawl is the capital town of the State built in tiers along the hill.

The Mizos have three main festivals—Mim Kut, Chapchar Kut and Pawl Kut. These festivals are associated with their agricultural activities during which they enjoy life by singing and dancing. The Mizos, blessed as they are with a beautiful environment and rich culture, are a vibrant and social people. They love to dance as much as they love to sing. They boast a number of folk and community dances handed down from one generation to the other through the ages. The dances are expressions of the gay, carefree spirit of the Mizos. It should be noted here that these dances are not intended for stage performance, rather they have been evolved for community involvement and participation.

1. In the text, seeing Valli travelling alone in the bus, some of the characters showed concerns.

An elderly woman asked, “Are you alone, dear?”

The Conductor questioned, “Won’t your mother be looking for you?”

The old woman continued asking, “Is it proper for such a young person to travel alone? Do you exactly know where you’re going in town? What’s the street? What’s the house number?”

Do you think that the concerns of the elderly lady and the conductor are apt and genuine? Will you say that it is applicable to young boys as well? Discuss in groups, make note and then arrange a debate competition. You can consider the following points for discussion or debate. Then write a paragraph considering these issues and give your opinion as well.

•	 Girls and boys of Valli’s age can travel alone in a bus or auto rickshaw, etc.   
•	 Freedom should be given to them to move around.   
•	 Safety of the young children is of utmost concern.   
•	 What type of education should be given to them?   
•	 This is a vulnerable age and children are innocent.

Everything remains exactly as it was.

I am I, and you are you,

Whatever we were to each other, that we are still.

Call me by the old familiar name.

Speak of me in the easy way which you always used.

Put no difference into your tone.

Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.

Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together.

Play, smile, think of me, pray for me.

Let my name be ever the household word that it always was.

Let it be spoken without an effort, without the ghost of a shadow upon it.

Life means all that it ever meant.

It is the same as it ever was.

There is absolute and unbroken continuity.

What is this death but a negligible accident?

Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight?

I am but waiting for you, for an interval,

somewhere very near,

All is well.

Nothing is hurt; nothing is lost.

One brief moment and all will be as it was before.

How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again!

# Text I

Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow.

In the future, if we want a happier humanity, a happy world, we must tackle the root of the problem. Of course the economy and political power are also causes. But the ultimate cause lies within the human mind. Every human action, verbal or physical,

even minor actions, have some motivation. Proper motivation or proper development is an important factor. Thus, if intelligence is accompanied with human affection and compassion, what I call human feeling, then it is very useful.

If society’s moral values and standards of behaviour become negative, each of us will suffer. Therefore, the intentions of an individual are very much related to the interests of society. There is a definite correlation.

The educational system and family life are two very important areas. In the educational field, one has to take care not only of the brain, but also of one’s spiritual development. I say “spiritual development” not in a religious sense but simply in the sense of having a good and compassionate heart. If one has a compassionate heart, it automatically brings inner strength and allows for less fear and less doubt. Subsequently, one becomes happier and more open-minded, thus making more friends in society.

The old priest Peter Gilligan

Was weary night and day,

For half his flock were in their beds,

Or under green sods lay.

Once while he nodded on a chair,

At the moth - hour of eve,

Another poor man sent for him,

And he began to grieve.

“I have no rest, nor joy, nor peace,

For people die and die;”

And after cried he, “God forgive!

My body spake, not I!”

And then, half-lying on the chair,

He knelt, prayed, fell asleep;

And the moth-hour went from the fields,

And stars began to peep.

They slowly into millions grew,

And leaves shook in the wind;

And God covered the world with shade,

And whispered to mankind.

Upon the time of sparrow chirp

When the moths came once more,

The old priest Peter Gilligan

Stood upright on the floor.

“Mavrone, Mavrone! The man has died,

While I slept on the chair,”

He roused his horse out of its sleep

And rode with little care.

He rode now as he never rode,

By rocky lane and fen;

The sick man’s wife opened the door:

“Father! You come again!”

“And is the poor man dead?” he cried.

“He died an hour ago.”

The old priest Peter Gilligan

In grief swayed to and fro.

“When you were gone he turned and died, As merry as a bird.”

The old priest Peter Gilligan

He knelt him at that word.

“He who hath made the night of stars

For souls who tire and bleed,

Sent one of His great angles down

To help me in my need.

# Grammar

# Reported Speech

We use direct speech when we repeat someone’s words and indirect speech when we use our own words to report what someone else has said. We use an appropriate reporting verb, make pronominal (relating to pronouns) changes and change certain words denoting ‘nearness’ in the direct form to words suggesting ‘remoteness’ (in time and place) in the indirect form.

It is said, “It is not how much we have, but how much we enjoy that makes happiness.”

Being happy does not require everything to be good but an eye to see good in everything. One day a crow saw a swan. “This swan is so white,” he thought, “and I am so black. This swan must be the happiest bird in the world.”

The swan replied, “I was feeling that I was the happiest bird around. But I think the parrot is the happiest bird as it has two colours.” The crow then approached the parrot. The parrot said, “I have only two colours, but the peacock has multiple colours.”

The crow then visited a peacock in the zoo. “Dear peacock,” the crow said, “you are so beautiful. Every day, thousands of people come to see you. You are the happiest bird on the planet.”

The peacock said, “I always thought that I was the most beautiful and happy bird on the planet. But I am entrapped in this zoo. I have realised that the crow is the only bird not kept in a cage, and could happily roam everywhere.”

The fascinating and world famous Sanchi stupa is located on a hilltop in Sanchi town, Madhya Pradesh, India. It is one of the most important Buddhist monuments that portrays Buddhist art and sculpture. Starting from the third century BC through the twelfth century AD, it

![](images/1e93f73a9e5b50968d861a0679784889c2031a2de6d260bab6f8ca138c403b43.jpg)

attracts the attention of thousands of visitors round the year including national and foreign tourists, archaeologists, and historians among others.

This stupa is the oldest stone structure in India that was built during the Mauryan period. Originally commissioned in the third century BCE by Emperor Ashoka, this huge hemispherical dome consists of a central chamber. In this chamber, the relics of Lord Buddha are placed. The original construction work of this stupa was supervised by Ashoka. His wife, Devi, was the daughter of a merchant of nearby village, Vidisha. Sanchi was also her birthplace as well as the venue of her and Ashoka’s wedding. Later, four ornamental gateways or toranas facing four directions and a balustrade surrounding the stupa were added in the first century BCE. The Great stupa at Sanchi is one of the oldest stone structures in India and counted among the best conserved ancient stupas of Central India. It has been enlisted as an UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1989.

# Speaking

It is important to know that everyone has some problem or other, and they grieve in unique ways. Your grief is different than those around you. You have experienced a loss or an intense sorrow, especially caused by someone’s death. This can also refer to the loss of physical or cognitive abilities or the loss of something that was routine in your life such as friendship, head boy or head girl, playing for school, etc.

Discuss with your friend and note down—

• what could be the possible reasons for someone’s grief or sorrow.   
• how can they overcome this.

Share your feelings and suggestions in the class.

# Writing

1. Write a paragraph on how you can help others who are in grief. You may consider the following points:

• grief is expressed through a variety of behaviours— observe these   
• reach out to others in their grief, but some people may not want to accept help; some will not share their grief— understand this   
• some others will want to talk about their thoughts and feelings—be a support to them, stand by them   
• let the grieving person know you care for them—be patient   
• focus on what you can do, like holding their hand, etc.—a solace or a consolation

2. Two poems are given in the textbook, First Flight, page 138–139, one by Kahlil Gibran, and the other by Rabindra Nath Tagore.

2. You have read ‘The Proposal’, a one act play. It is a farce. The play is set in only one location, the drawing room of Chubukov’s house. All three characters in the play are quarrelsome people and they quarrel over petty issues. Lomov and Natalya start with the issue like a piece of land that is situated at the border between the two neighbors’ properties. The discussion turns into a quarrel and the marriage proposal is forgotten. They shout at each other. They are again dragged into an argument over the superiority of each other’s dogs. So, they drag their ancestors in their foolish quarrel. They again abuse each other and call names.

Now, make groups of four and discuss the following points. While conducting the discussion, try to use the facial expressions given above.

•	 The marriage proposal is a mockery of romance and marriage in the upper class.   
•	 The pride in property, even the superiority of dogs, take priority over love and marriage.   
•	 The characters lack patience, stop listening to each other, and then contradict each other.   
•	 Do you think these quarrels will promise a happy life?   
•	 What qualities would you consider for a well-matched couple?   
•	 Do you think all of us should know how to manage our anger?

# How Can We Control Anger?

Do you get angry when your mother switches off the television? Do you get upset when you lose a game? Do you crib when your teacher does not pay attention to you? Most of us can have “yes” as an answer to one or more of these situations. Anger sometimes gets the better of us and leaves us to regret the consequences later. The question is ‘How can we control anger?’

Anger is a normal and healthy emotion only if we know how to respond to it. Uncontrolled anger can often harm us directly or

# Look Up and Understand

aggressive assertive consequences distress grudge uncontrolled

indirectly whether we realise or not. Before we learn to address the issue, let us revisit the concept of anger. Anger is nothing but absence of peace with oneself, people or situations around us. We express it either by being assertive or aggressive.

Let us all become the managers of our own anger. When angry, take a few moments to calm down (take five deep breaths, count up to ten, drink water, change your place) before responding. More often than not we do not have control over the situations that distress us. Getting physically active reduces stress. Funny dances, clapping, thumping your feet, a walk, making funny faces at the mirror, etc., go a long way in helping us let go of the anger or the frustration inside us. Once we have our feelings under control, go through all the aspects of the situation and try to see the same situation from different perspectives. If it is a problem try to equip yourself with a few solutions before entering the same situation. Avoid holding a grudge with people and learn when to seek help from others. Realising your own shortcomings can become one of the greatest strengths of character over the years to come.

We can never control circumstances, people or situations as they are constantly changing. The only thing we can control is our response. So we have to increase our capacity to tolerate, ability to understand, and learn to nurture love for others.

Q.1. What do you understand by the word ‘anger’?

# On Violence

There is a great deal of violence in the world. There is physical violence and also inward violence. Physical violence is to kill another, to hurt other people consciously, deliberately or without thought, to say cruel things, full of antagonism and hate and inwardly, inside the skin, to dislike people, to hate people, to criticise people. Inwardly, we are always quarrelling, battling, not only with others, but with ourselves. We want people to change, we want to force them to our way of thinking.

In the world, as we grow up, we see a great deal of violence, at all levels of human existence. The ultimate violence is war—the killing for ideas, for so-called religious principles, for nationalities, the killing to preserve a little piece of land. To do that, man will kill, destroy, maim, and also be killed himself. There is enormous violence in the world, the rich wanting to keep people poor, and the poor wanting to get rich and in the process hating the rich. And you, being caught in society, are also going to contribute to this.

There is violence between husband, wife, and children. There is violence, antagonism, hate, cruelty, ugly criticism, anger—all this is inherent in man, inherent in each human being. It is

# Look U and Understand

antagonism consciously deliberately inherent maim

# Look Up and Understand

aggressiveness

brutality

exploded

vaporised

inherent in you. And education is supposed to help you to go beyond all that, not merely to pass an examination and get a job. You have to be educated so that you become a really beautiful, healthy, sane, rational human being, not a brutal man with a very clever brain who can argue and defend his brutality. You are going to face all this violence as you grow up. You will forget all that you have heard here, and will be caught in the stream of society. You will become like the rest of the cruel, hard, bitter, angry, violent world, and you will not help to bring about a new society, a new world.

But a new world is necessary. A new culture is necessary. The old culture is dead, buried, burnt, exploded, and vaporised. You have to create a new culture. A new culture cannot be based on violence. The new culture depends on you because the older generation has built a society based on violence, based on aggressiveness and it is this that has caused all the confusion, all the misery. The older generations have produced this world and you have to change it. You cannot just sit back and say, “I will follow the rest of the people and seek success and position.” If you do, your children are going to suffer. You may have a good time, but your children are going to pay for it. So, you have to take all that into account, the outward cruelty of man to man in the name of god, in the name of religion, in the name of self-importance, in the name of the security of the family. You will have to consider the outward cruelty and violence, and the inward violence which you do not yet know.

# Reported speech

1. Some children are taken to a health clinic for a regular checkup. Rewrite the sentences they speak in reported speech. (Use complain, say, tell, ask, inquire, mention, etc., wherever necessary.)

Ashish : I feel sleepy all the time.

Neha : I get pain in my legs when I run.

Sonal :	 I’m fine.

Ritu : I had fever last week.

Akash : Why do I always cough?

Rehman	 :	 Should I walk everyday to keep myself fit?

Sumi : Oh, thank you, Doctor. Now I know the reason for my constant stomach-ache.

•	 Though ‘tell’ and ‘say’ almost mean the same, there are differences in the usage of the two words. ‘Tell’ is always followed by an indirect object but ‘say’ is not.

# Example

I told my sister that she was right.

Ashish said he worked hard to achieve success.

# Vanka

(Vanka Zhukov, a nine-year old boy, was made an assistant to Alyakhin, the Shoemaker. He didn’t go to bed on Christmas Eve. When everyone in the shop had gone to Church, he began to write on a crumpled sheet of paper. “Dear Grandfather Konstantin, he wrote”, I’m writing a letter to you. I wish you a Merry Christmas and all good things from the Lord God. I’ve no father and mother, and you are all I have left.”)

Vanka raised his eyes to the dark windowpane. In his imagination he saw his grandfather Konstantin standing there. His grandfather was a night watchman on the estate of a rich man. Konstantin was a small, thin and lively old man of sixty-five whose face was always crinkling with laughter. In the daytime the old man slept in the servant’s kitchen or cracked jokes with the cooks. At night, wrapped in a big sheepskin coat he made rounds of the estate, blowing his whistle at regular intervals. He was always followed by his dogs, Brownie and Eel. Eel was a particularly remarkable dog. He was extremely respectful and endearing and looked lovingly on friends and strangers alike; yet no one trusted him. He would creep behind someone and bite his leg or run off with a peasant’s chicken. Many a time Eel was beaten mercilessly, yet he always managed to survive.

At this very moment, Vanka thought, grandfather was probably standing by the gates, looking up at the bright red windows of the village church and cracking jokes with the servants.

“What about a pinch of snuff?” he would say, holding out his snuffbox to the women.

The women would take a pinch and sneeze and the old man would feel happy about it. “Fine for frozen noses, eh!” he’d say.

The dogs, too, were given snuff. Brownie would sneeze, shake her head and walk away looking hurt. Eel, too polite to sneeze, only wagged his tail.

Vanka looked through the window. The weather was glorious. The air was fresh. The night was very dark, but the roofs of the houses and trees were all covered with snow.

Stars twinkled in the sky and it appeared that they had been washed and placed there only for the holidays.

Vanka sighed, and went on writing: “Yesterday I was given a beating. That was because when I was rocking the baby in the cradle, I unfortunately fell asleep. Another day the mistress of the house asked me to clean the fish. I didn’t know how, so she rubbed the fish all over my face. My friends laughed at me. Then there’s nothing to eat. In the morning they give me bread, there is porridge for dinner and in the evening only bread again. The master and the mistress eat all the good things themselves. I sleep in the corridor and when the baby cries, I don’t get any sleep at all because I’ve to rock the cradle. Dear Grandfather, please take me away from here, take me to the village, it’s more than I can bear.” Vanka rubbed his eyes with his fists and sobbed.

“I’ll grind your snuff for you, he went on”, I’ll pray to God to keep you healthy and if I ever do anything wrong, you can beat me as you like. If you think there’s no place for me then I can clean boots or even work as a shepherd boy. Grandfather, it’s more than I can bear. I thought of running away to the village, but I don’t have any boots. If you’ll help me now, I’ll feed you when I grow up and when you die I’ll pray for your soul just like I do for my mother.

“Dear Grandfather, when they put up the Christmas tree at the big house, please take down a golden walnut for me and hide it in the green box. Ask the young mistress Olga, and say it is for Vanka.”

Vanka sighed and gazed in the direction of the window. He remembered it was grandfather who always went to the forest to cut down a Christmas tree for the rich people, taking Vanka with him. They had a wonderful time together, the snow falling, the trees crackling and hares springing across the trees,

When the tree had been chopped down, grandfather would drag it to the big house and they would start decorating it. The young mistress Olga, Vanka’s favourite, was the busiest of all. Vanka’s mother, when alive, had worked as Olga’s maid. Then Olga had given him all the sweets and played a lot with Vanka. But after his mother’s death, Vanka was sent to the kitchen to be with his grandfather and from there to Alyakhin, the shoemaker.

“Come to me, dear grandfather,” Vanka wrote on, “Please, take me away from here, have pity on me, a poor orphan. They are always beating me. I’m terribly hungry and so miserable that I’m always crying. Remember me to all my friends. I remain your grandson, Ivan Zhukov. Dear grandfather, please come soon.”

Vanka folded the sheet of paper and then put it in an envelope he had bought the previous day. He thought for a while, then wrote the address: To Grandfather in the Village. He added the words: Konstantin Makarich. He was happy that no one had disturbed him while he was writing his letter. He ran out to the street to post it. Vanka had been told by the clerks that letter were dropped in boxes from where they were carried all over the world on mail coaches drawn by horse and driven by drunken drivers, while the bells jingled. Vanka ran to the nearest mailbox and put his letter in it.

An hour later, lulled by sweetest hopes, he was fast asleep. He dreamed of a stove. His grandfather was sitting beside it, reading out his letter to the cooks. Eel, the dog, was walking round the stove, wagging his tail.

# Role Play

Smita : Well! What do you think about violence on television?

Romila : If you ask me, there is too much violence on television. Children should not be exposed to it.

Smita : I don’t agree with you. Why do you say so?

Romila	 :	 It’s not wise to expose children to a lot of fighting, shooting, stabbing, and killing.

Smita	 :	 But children find it thrilling.

Romila : No, they don’t. On the contrary it brutalises them and makes them insensitive. They look upon violence and killing as common place incidents.

Smita : But the young people now-a-days are quite violent.

Romila	 :	 Precisely. It is the influence of television. Wouldn’t it be better if through television we give them the message of peace and togetherness.
